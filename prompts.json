I learned that there are scenarios where some apparently less efficient solutions are actually more efficient and should be kept in mind.\n2. One of the most valued characteristics of a good UI is letting people have as much control as possible, so as to satisfy all user groups.\n3. I made a mistake that lead to a breakdown on some internal service during an internship. I learned that testing is important in real life.\n4. I learned that the simplest can sometimes beat the most innotative. I strive to buld solutions that are better suited for the end user.\n5. When my code got  deployed, it broke the program, meaning nobody could sign up for shifts.   I needed to validate the results of my code.\n6. I learned that being over zealous and volunteering can not only harm me, but could be a huge inconvenience to others as well.\n7.
