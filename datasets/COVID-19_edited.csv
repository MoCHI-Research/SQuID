"Because I'm, I'm a drag performer at [inaudible 00:13:50]. It was really hard for all of us to kind of lose our jobs, especially for those of us that are not only performers, but have jobs in the service industry." 
"But something that really gave me hope was the fact that like right now, the whole community is, or most of the community, is making live videos and trying to put up Broadway performances and [inaudible] stuff." 
"And everybody's still tipping each other, even if they're struggling, too." 
"And kind of passing on whatever money they can actually support everybody with."
"So it's kind of cool like how, even though we're all kind of struggling and we all obviously need support, we are still helping each other in a way and calling each other." 
"And just being like each other's emotional support, too. So that definitely gave me hope."
"Mowgli would like to go next. I mean Mowgli and all the humans are home, and that gives me hope."
"To be fair, the only thing that really gives me hope is the fact that a lot of people have been very nice to each other." 
"Like those who are doing better than some of us, for example I'm part of the kitchen workers. So I was basically in a very bad sad place." 
"For a lot of us there's no safety net, there's nothing we can do about this whole situation." 
"But at the very least, there's been a lot of managers, a lot of friends, a lot of people we all know that kind of reach out to us and try to help."
"But at the end of the day, there's so much everybody else could do to improve something. You just end up without a safety net."
"I think that one of the main concerns is that people aren't taking it as seriously as we should." 
"I think there are people that are still up and about doing unnecessary things, exposing themselves. Which creates more exposure for everybody that they come in contact with." 
"And, of course, like one of the biggest concerns I have is my family, and especially because some of them are not here." 
"So having my family in another country and not being able to access them or have them come, or be able to see them, especially because my parents are older. I think that's one of the my main concerns."
"And of course, making sure that my family and my friends are taken care of." 
"Because I know that this affects everyone economically." 
"The economy is going to be doing really, really bad and that's, I think, one of the biggest concerns after the whole thing passes. So, yeah."
"For one of my financial concerns because living in Madison, City of Madison hasn't really given a crap about people of color, especially black people, as a social stance, because they all are fake liberal." 
"So it's just seeing that now all this stuff is happening, and people who work jobs that are actually like you can't work from home, you have to be physically there to do it, whether that be a trade job or working in kitchen."
"Yeah, like actually doing something with your hands, where you can't do it from somewhere else." 
"Even though people chose that career because they enjoy that work, it's still like now what are you supposed to do?"
"Because everyone who's saying that they want to help, or all the people that are helping, not saying that they want to help." 
"All the foundations and all the companies and stuff that are helping, they're small companies or community focused. It's not like a big corporation or like the government or like utility companies." 
"People aren't stopping bills, they're postponing eviction, which is cute, but it's like you still got to pay that money." 
"And if you haven't been making money this whole time, then how you supposed to pay back something that you couldn't afford in the first place."
"So it just keeps you like 'What am I supposed to do. Should I work, is it worth risking going out to work because I need money, or should I stay home?'"
"And I think that working for some people right now is a necessity." 
"There are some people that can't just say I'm going to stay home and be safe. It's not a luxury that they can afford at this moment." 
"Because they have children, because they have rent to pay, because they have whatever to pay for." 
"So that just makes it all stressful, because you're trying to limit all the contact that people have." 
"But then when people have to go out and work and have contact with all these ... like it's how do you do it?"
"Because there's like a big amount of people that can't file for unemployment or won't get accepted."
"Right. And just unemployment shouldn't be the answer because it's also a long process." 
"Like my sister. She helps people with applying for unemployment and she was telling me about how the lines were saturated becausem like a bunch of people were calling at the same time, so she has to be on wait for like three hours to help just one person." 
"So imagine the people that are not getting helped through this(unemployment). Like it's just very unaccessible sometimes."
"And they ask for so much information that a lot of people don't even have at hand."
"I mean I lost all of my income, because I am a performer and I own a salon, and I can't do either right now." 
"So I'm just like, I don't have really a lot of options." 
"The good thing is that I guess like I had some money saved. So I'll be okay to get through the next couple of weeks." 
"But at the same time, we don't know how long this is going to last." 
"Because they'll tell us a couple weeks, but we really don't know." 
"Because new information keeps coming every day and everything keeps changing." 
"So at this point, we just all have to kind of look at all of your options and figure out what we're going to be able to do to keep surviving."
"Like I said before, I'm part of a kitchen staff, I work as a cook. I was one of the first ones to get closed down." 
"And right now you just have to figure out how to stretch your money as much as possible, and find different ways to get income." 
"I myself am able to get unemployment." 
"And like someone who said before unemployment is just not an answer to the question right now how are we going to survive?" 
"That's the government just giving their backs to everybody, and that's not okay."
"Fortunately I've had the, like I'm lucky enough to not be financially affected by it right now." 
"I still able to work from home and able to get my income, but a lot of people that are in worse situations than I am." 
"Like my sister, she worked at Madison College, and her partner worked at a restaurant, and they have a kid and now neither of them have income coming in." 
"So like for families like that, that's what I'm wondering how they're going to be able to handle that especially for families that can't file for unemployment at all." 
"So they can't get any sort of income, and it's people that have been working two three jobs just to get by. And now, how are they going to do that?"
"I think for me working in the medical field, it's been it's been kind of tough I guess, because we've had so many like [inaudible] there I guess." 
"That is just kind of like a big pressure that if someone is positive, then I've been with them, so it's like ... if that makes sense."
"It's just kind of like [crosstalk] that fear every day that you don't know what's going to happen. I guess."
"Because even those that are affected by it with work, they still are risking themselves by going out to work."
"It affects everybody emotionally, and not just financially."
"Well, I worked in horticulture, indoor horticulture, so I do a private company with a whole bunch of different businesses around Madison." 
"And I started feeling this as soon as corporate America started feeling it, because my clients started calling and saying that they were closed." 
"And so I've been changing my people around and working like crazy to try to water and protect all these plants for however these people are going to closed for."
"My boss who owns the company, he's already talked to me and told me how we're most likely going to lose clients because of this." 
"Because some small businesses, that when they do open up whenever they can, if their plants are dead, they're not going to be able to afford different new plants and restart up the contract." 
"And so if we can't afford to insure all of these businesses with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of plants, to replace everything just because of a crisis." 
"So the fact that I'm already losing clients, losing hours."
"And then now like yeah, it was busy and great for me last week, because I was preparing for all these closures. But now this week all my clients are closed, so I'm like just sitting here waiting." 
"And so that's one aspect of just like not really knowing the future of that."
"And it's really sad, because that's actually a career that I enjoy, and it's one of my passions." 
"So we'll just have to see how that business is affected by all of this." 
"But it also was putting a risk at me, because I made contact with so many people every single day, going in and out of offices of hundreds of people each day, and going through at least four offices a day." 
"I was very high risk of exposure. Like even one of the places that I watered was St. Mary's Hospital or I would also do the airport."
"So it's like going to the hospital and getting tested, or getting checked or whatever, into the hospital, but then the next day finding out that that hospital has doctors that are testing positive and giving it to their patients is like ... like all of that is scary." 
"So it makes it so it's like nothing's really safe in that career field." 
"But then my other job managing a winery. And the service industry is another place that we're getting hit really hard." 
"Just because you can only do take out, and no one really is like trying to take out like that." 
"I have some regulars that are really trying to support the business and they're trying to, like they bought a couple cases of wines, trying to support and make sure that we have some kind of income."
"But I had to lay off, indefinitely, all of my employees, because ... none of them are full time, this is all a wine store shop." 
"So it's like now I'm telling them that there's no hours for anybody, because they can't make tips." 
"So there's no reason for them to come in." 
"And it's just been really hard having those conversations with other people who are trying to feed themselves and their families." 
"And students who are now like, they don't even know where they're supposed to stay, what they're supposed to do, what their actual obligations are ... the companies are to their education." 
"Everything is up in the air." 
"And it's just really hard because like both of those positions are affected greatly. So in return I am affected greatly."
"I'm growing my beard out. It's great."
"I'll try to grow my mustache out. It's coming in real nicely now." 
"So I think that with all the things going on, I haven't really had time, which is come up with a self care routine or a self care, I don't know, something." 
"Just because everything has been so chaotic and everything is just happening." 
"And I'm barely trying to get accustomed to work from home and doing all the virtual meetings, and doing all of that. And finding a way for me to get organized with that." 
"So, everything is still kind of messy." 
"So for self care, I honestly haven't done much besides pet Mowgli and Deku and go on walks with them."
"I went super crazy when this first started and I started cleaning everything." 
"And then I realized, I was like I need to stop to do everything because I'm going to run out of things to do." 
"So now I've been trying to grow past [inaudible] doing things like my brushes and stuff, like my makeup brushes I haven't cleaned them at all." 
"Because I'm trying to leave them for last moment just so I don't run out of things to do." 
"Because I feel like once I run out of things to do I'm just going to freak out." 
"So, I also went to buy supplies for my [inaudible] projects and stuff. Like making wigs and making lashes." 
"Like extra stuff that I know that will kill time, just in case I need something to do."
"I guess I got these wipes, they're nice. They cover your face."
"I got chickens. That was my self care. I got little chickadees." 
"And I also started working on my garden for the summer." 
"And I also have put a lot of time into starting something I've always wanted to do, which is urban agriculture consulting group or company." 
"And so I started doing that virtually, because everything's virtual nowadays." 
"And that's been pretty cool to being able to try to get people to grow their own food, trying to find some other way to occupy myself and find some other way to not feel so at the will of whatever society's doing."
"Again, work at the Department of Health, and we had an exhibit in our action center called Undesigned the Red Line. And so, it talks about redlining as a racist historical practice around housing and around access to finances, and financial institutions related to housing." 
"And so, we have the exhibit, we worked with a small firm called designing the WE, W-E, who curated the exhibit." 
"And so we have the map of the Bronx, and we had about 100 tours that we did throughout 2018, and we had approximately 850 folks come through the exhibit."
"So the story is that everyone who came through the exhibit had a story about housing and where they live or their neighborhoods, and how they've been impacted by policies." 
"I mean the brunt of the redlining is really around black people and people of color and how the government sanctioned these races maps to push people out, and steer people to the suburbs that you all have experience with."
"But the story is that not only did people have a story about it, but a lot of people were significantly relieved by the fact that they understood that there was a policy that was driving this." 
"So when you go into communities, I work in the East [Tremont] section of the Bronx. Born and bred and buttered in Harlem, predominantly these were segregated neighborhoods that were impacted by redlining." 
"And a lot of those people who came to me were just relieved by the fact that, you know what, this community looks the way it looks, and similar to what you're talking about in terms of like that feeling like where is that anger and feeling being rejected?"
"And so a lot of people internalize the feeling like I did something wrong or my parents did something wrong, or my grandparents did something wrong. But in fact, there were policies that put this in place." 
"And I enjoyed doing the tours, so I led a lot of them and we just had people who would just cry, who were just angry." 
"I mean we said in our community agreement that don't expect closure, because it's not the exhibit that's going to give you closure." 
"But you're free to continue to study as you like." 
"But, yeah, people were significantly impacted by the fact that it was actually a policy, that it wasn't their fault. Really is the bottom line."
"But there's all kinds of stuff that happens with subsidized housing." 
"Just affordable housing in general with how gentrification is going now." 
"The place that I grew up and I would never, ever, ever move back to, is now being redone and is supposed to be like one of the nicest places. It makes no sense."
"I mean yeah everybody's experience is different, right? It depends on what situation you're in." 
"So obviously it affects everybody differently, especially people that are in that situation."
"I feel like typically it affects low income people and people of color."
"But the worst part is that just they typically don't have a say in how these policies go. [inaudible]"
"They just need to learn how to actually be organized and listen to the community, instead of trying to make all these decisions based on whatever they think." 
"Because what we need now is support and comfort, because obviously the situation is bad no matter what and it's probably going to get a lot worse before it gets better." 
"And right now what everybody's doing is either not taking it seriously at all or freaking out." 
"So I think what they need to do is educate, try to educate everybody on the topic, but also not make it seem like we're all going to die." 
"Because I feel like that (we're all going to die) is what a lot of people are thinking right now."
"And those two groups of people are just making this situation escalate way more than it should be."
"I feel like they need to start listening more to what the community is saying." 
"And yeah, stop this hysteria from propagating because everybody's going crazy about this topic." 
"Everybody is losing their minds and fear just gets spreading amongst us and that's just not a good way, that's not a good policy."
"I personally just think very similarly, of course, they have to listen to the concerns of the community and address them more properly and more accurately." 
"I do understand that we're in the middle of chaos. It's really hard for them to follow proper protocols sometimes." 
"But also, like when it comes to local representatives, there's only so much that they can do." 
"So I don't have a lot of faith in all that and all the things that they're going to be able to do for us." 
"As for the level of comfort, I feel like every day I feel less comforted by the government, less than I was before this whole crisis." 
"For me, I think that first they need to actually work with the medical system and the doctors and support the doctors how they need to be supported." 
"Because I did my little interview thingy by virtual visit, because of having symptoms and possibly being exposed from going to the hospital." 
"And the doctor was damn near venting to me about how she was irritated with all of this." 
"She's telling me that I can't get a test because they aren't even able to get tests." 
"And she's telling me unless I'm actually dying and can't breathe and if I'm old, then it doesn't matter. And asthma doesn't matter."
"And she even told me like, 'Well, even if you got a test, we don't know what to do with it.'" 
"'So if you're positive or negative, you're still supposed to do the same thing, which is stay at home and drink fluids or whatever.'" 
"And so it's like right now, the medical professionals don't really know what the hell's happening and they're not able to get a good source of information and support." 
"It's like it just means that we're all just left out here to our own mind. And that's very dangerous." 
"And I feel like they need protection, the doctors don't feel protected, they're getting it and they're spreading it to patients because they have to work." 
"But they also aren't given all the masks and the gloves and whatever precautions that they need." 
"I almost quit because I was on hold on a virtual waiting room for like six hours, and I'm like this is stupid I wouldn't even wait this long in the actual waiting room. I would have been left by now."
"So like this is very dumb. And also for the lady to be like, yo, I'm mad, too, I don't know what to tell you." 
"So it's like literally no one knows what to do or what to say. So that's kind of upsetting." 
"But I feel like the medical field needs help, because they're the ones that people are looking towards getting a response and getting an answer to, so they need the support to get to that point."
"Somebody needs to actually become a boss and do what needs to be done for the people, actually lead, instead of just saying that they are." 
"There needs to be someone who actually does it." 
"No, it's not going to be beautiful, people are going to be mad. The rich people are going to be upset because they're not making money." 
"But no one needs to make money right now, people need to stay alive. [crosstalk] That's what the focus needs to be on."
"And that's the issue with just like our local representatives, they don't have so much control over that." 
"And the people that actually do, they are the rich people, they are the rich people that are not going to be wanting these things to happen." 
"So it's just stupid, it's just stupid because they will never give up the resources that they don't want to give to help other people. Because for them it's not worth it. So it's just dumb."
[crosstalk] like celebrities shouldn't have to donate it. Government should make sure that hospitals have the things [crosstalk 00:46:41].
"And the medical field is really short on equipment, so that doesn't help."
"That's scary. [inaudible] scariest part of all of it, but it's not even just the illness, it's the fact that if people get sick in masses, the hospitals don't have the resources." 
"They don't have the doctor, they don't have the staff, they don't have anything to be able to follow up with it. And I think that's the scariest part."
"Yeah, they already barely had enough resources when this started. and now it increased so much more."
"Yeah, I believe the biggest fear is us turning into Italy, where literally they don't know what to do." 
"They have too many patients and there's no exit for them there's no good way to solve this problem. So, therefore, everybody, I guess."
"Yeah, because also young people dying now because they are waiting in waiting rooms forever because there are no doctors to get to them. Like it's [crosstalk]"
"And like the lady told me to wear a mask, because I have roommates, but how am I supposed to get a mask when the doctors can't get a mask?" 
"Like stuff like that don't make sense. It's like all ... the medical material, they all have to go to them and there's still not enough."
"Yeah, like I don't even got a thermometer." 
"They're telling me to check my fever. How am I supposed to get a thermometer? They're all gone. [crosstalk]"
"We had to, at work, we have to monitor ourselves." 
"And one of the things is to check your temperature two times a day." 
"It was a struggle to find a thermometer. It took me a couple days to find one." 
"I want to who knows how many stores trying to find one, and that was like right after everybody went chaotic and bought all the toilet paper and thermometers."
"Do pets have thermometers? Can we use a pet thing?"
"I also noticed like these Facebook group where people are posting like Target has toilet paper and disinfecting wipes." 
"And then you're posting this to 4000 people on a Facebook group. And then I'm assuming if everybody's seeing it, everybody's going to be running to get these things. [crosstalk]"
"Well the good thing is that now they started limiting what everybody can buy." 
"I just want to shopping and only one pack of toilet paper per family, which is what should be done because [inaudible] crazy. Right?"
"Or maybe they do need more than one pack, because they don't know how to cook either, so they probably got the boo-boos." 
"Because these people [crosstalk] they don't have no groceries in their house, they have no cleaning supplies or toilet paper." 
"I'm like how have you all been living. I already have this shit."
"One of my co workers, he's ... I'm going to take a lucky guess and say he's from Africa. Don't quote me on that one. But I came into the lunch room and the first thing he said to me and this other coworker was, 'Do you think we're going to survive this?'"
"Like fear, like with such a fear." 
"And then the other coworker was like, 'Are you serious,' or like 'Are you seriously frightened?' But like in a serious question. And he was like, 'Yeah, I don't know if we're going to get through this.'" 
"And I was like, 'Yes, yes we are.'" 
"Even though I'm scared as shit, too." 
"But I was like we got this." 
"But it's like everyone is freaking out."
"I think that's another thing, even in the health care, it's more of keeping the patients and coworkers secure than our families." 
"Like while here at work, we have to take certain precautions when we're with patients." 
"But, at home, it's like once we're out, we're out. If that makes sense. [crosstalk]"
"I think the scariest part of all of this is the fact that like, we really don't know when it's going to end, like that is what's scary."
"Because a lot of us are holding on tight as of now, and this just started. So, if it goes on even longer that's what's scary." 
"That's what's making everybody freak out, because you at least want to know how long you're going to be without income, you know?"
"And the fact is that this is going to get worse before it gets better."
"So there's no telling when it's going to end."
