"Well, I hope I experience justice and fairness every day from the time that I get up in the morning and the way I am with my wife and my family. I think I experience through the day just..." 
"I think it's the small things that count, from when you hold the door open for a lady walking into a building or the simple thing, just smiling at somebody and having them smile back at you I think goes a long way every day and makes this world a better place." 
"I understand that we don't live in a perfect society, and we don't live in a perfect criminal justice but I do believe and I work for us to live in a better world."
"I guess the simplest thing to do is when you treat others as you feel like you should be treated, that is justice in itself. You expect them to, if not return it, at least honor that you have made your best attempt to treat them that way."
"Okay. Growing up, I think it's most kids' dreams that when they grow up to either be a police office or a fireman." 
"When (my uncle) retired, he was the acting police chief here in Mobile, Alabama. I was very fortunate to be able to go to work with him on different occasions and experience his job very in person with him."
"What the police do for the community, you can't measure it. There are so many police officers out there that truly, truly want to help, and they have nothing but the best of intentions." 
"But on the flip side, we have police officers out there that are underpaid, and when they're underpaid, we don't necessarily get the very best of candidates to put out there on the street that interacts with the public."
"A negative experience that I did have with the police happened at Mardi Gras here in Mobile." 
"They were hyping the crowd up by throwing the beads out there to the crowd. My daughter, five years old, is out there mimicking the news media, and she's throwing the beads out there herself. I was not in the room, and then the police made their way to the room."
"The police officer was very aggressive to my daughter at five years old." 
"When I got there, I was pretty upset about that. What I was most upset about is at her age, if she was able to get lost or whatever, she wouldn't reach out to a police officer for help having that negative experience that she had at five years old."
"I think the problem was at this particular time is there was a lot of overtime, they were tired." 
"I was able to of find a supervisor, and I was very fortunate that the supervisor sent that officer back up there to apologize to my child so she would understand that if she ever needed help, that's somebody that she could reach out there." 
"I watch the news just like everybody else and there are incidents with the police all over the country." 
"This is my own opinion. I mean, of course there are some police officers that should not be in the policing business. But any industry that we have, there are some good apples and bad apples." 
"When we do have those bad apples and when they have the authority that they do, it rises to the top. That's something I would very much like to address." 
"From my experience, the way that I have always seen and I still do, is the role of policing in the community is a necessity." 
"It is an order, a way of giving order. They do have authority. They have a lot of control over some things, but then again they don't." 
"I have a brother who has been to prison for 23 years. He's in and out, all this stuff. He did everything against the police department that you could possible do. He has no respect for authority, so I've watched him do those." 
"But I do believe that policing is important in communities. I live in a small community, we did not have any police officers until I was about 16, 17 years old. Of course, I was taught how to respond." 
"But with the gaps and the needs, I have a cousin who is a police office who does his very good job at what he does." 
"He shared with me that there is a mentally-ill adolescent in the community where he's a police officer. And so the police department itself got together and made an agreement that they would go out and always do a wellness check when they were called, but they would negotiate the situation and not arrest the guy."
"Well, that says a lot for initiative, but not everybody does that. My concern is the gaps are we are not well versed, we are not taught our jobs well enough." 
"You don't learn everything you need to know on the job, or you shouldn't. They need to know. Yes, we have laws, and that's all they are required to learn and there to know."
"They know what level they can go to and what their rights are and how they can handle those and how someone's supposed to act. However, why not train them in autism? Parents are arrested because their autistic child has bruises. Well, they're self-inflicted. So they're not very well-trained." 
"I believe there needs to be a lot of more training, a lot more opportunity for them to learn. And they should learn Chris' job. They should learn what this all entails because they're dealing with the general public. They're not dealing with a set amount of people or a particular group." 
"They need to know all the new behaviors that come out because I've dealt with all of the behaviors, academically, in a school setting."
"I know that in a school setting I am limited to what I can do. But if you take it out of the school setting, you have more authority and the legal department takes care of everything or the justice department." 
"But now, I think everyone needs to be more educated, taught more. Someone like myself can come up and say, 'This is what you do with these types of students.'" 
"I had a young man who was abused, and he was in the seventh grade." 
"A teacher came up and grabbed him by the arm. Well, guess what? Dad did that a lot in beatings. That teacher didn't know he slept on the front porch. That teacher didn't know he was abused, we did." 
"So we turned around and gave him that information. That would have caused a lot less trouble for that child. There's a lot of issues that I think our police officers are not equipped to handle. And so that's just basically on it."
"They're handling every situation that they come into as an individual situation. They're not all generic." 
"I know that domestic situations are very prevalent in my community. We have a lot of bootlegging in our community, just for the record."
"They handle that knowing the different sections of the community there's a lot of very heavy rule areas. And so you must treat those individuals differently, you approach them differently, and so they do. They're quick to respond. Their response time is very good." 
"They're very supportive of all the medical situations that come up because they always show up at any emergency situation medically as well. They've always been very good at doing that. They communicate very good. We only have a volunteer fire department, they communicate very well with that." 
"They've even gone so far as to follow them to a medical facility to make sure everything's okay. So they do very well that way in my community."
"The larger city of Gadsden, their response time is also the same. We deal a lot with not just the local police department, but we have a lot of county police officers who also come here because not everyone is in the city limit. But their response time is the same. There's never been a problem." 
"They're serious when they show up but they ask questions. They had a young lady that overdosed on heroin not far from my house. Everyone responded accordingly, and they did what they had to do." 
"Because I happen to know that the choice is you either go back to the hospital or they'll take you jail. So you have an option. And so they were kind about it. They were very patient. They stand there. They make sure no one interferes. They're always very good at that." 
"And so I can't say that they all have the same ideas but I've worked with some of them in a voluntary capacity. They're always jolly on the spot to support other organizations within the community as well. So [inaudible 00:22:57]."
"The best thing I could say is the gaps would be assistance with people who are drug involved. There's not enough support for the police to make appropriate handling of the situation." 
"When they do try to handle the situation to the best of their ability, a lot of times it would get blown out of proportion. So they do need more assistance in that area." 
"A lot of times when people are arrested for drugs, people are saying, 'Oh, it's just drugs.' But there are repercussions physically, familial. There's not even just those people but neighborhoods can be affected by that." 
"That is a disservice to the police officers that they are not getting the support that they need to handle that the way they need to handle it. We need to have more support for them where they handle it appropriately and potentially save lives in the future."
"I think a lot of things, what we see on the media is we see the worst of the worst." 
"It's very seldom, if not ever, that we see when a police officer has been out there and you have a family that calls, they have not heard from a grandmother, and they're able to knock on the door and find her where she's fallen and not been able to get up." 
"You never hear about the good things that a police officer is out there doing during his 8 or 12-hour shift every day. It's not all about his interaction with the bad guy." 
"I mean, there's so much more that they do that you never even hear about. I think the media should also reach out these local police departments so we can see the full spectrum of what a police officer does every day." 
"Maybe these guys from the media do a ride-along to see it firsthand, and not hear it but to actually be in the car and see it firsthand what they go through every day. There's no better learning experience than experience, so get out there and experience being a police officer."
"The drug situation falls in the same category. There's a lot of things that the officers do that they do not get any kudos for." 
"If there is a medical situation and there is a potential of risk to even to the fire department, the police are first on the scene. Fire department come in behind. They do not get enough kudos for that."
"I agree with Chris as far as we do see a great many reports of what's done wrong, and it goes what's called today viral. The media influences the general population tremendously." 
"Having been placed on the news myself, no one ever retracted and came back and said I was found not guilty. No one ever said that. That's just not ever done." 
"I don't think you're going to be able to do a story of what's wrong. I think everyone needs to know what's wrong. There are certain groups of communities that don't things correctly." 
"You know the Etowah County has been well, very well into the news. But the new sheriff who came in, no one has told that he is starting a new program for those in drug community, drug corrections."
"He has initiated this. He did a lot of the... If you watch the A&E program with Etowah County inside the county, no one has come back to look at that and say, not even A&E, that he replaced all the locks." 
"It's very simple and very easy for things to be torn up. You're not talking about people who are taught to take care of things. But I'd like to see a follow-up on that, something of that sort that helps us know." 
"Because as a population of people, we have to have some semblance of hope. But that's where our justice system fails is it's very difficult to see the hope." 
"My cousin, like I mentioned, they've come together as a unit in a very small community to deal with this mentally-ill teenager who is getting older." 
"He's not going to change. They make sure he takes his medication, that's what's so funny to me. But that's not the way he's going to be treated when he goes to other places, and that kind of stuff."
"Now, that's pretty much off the beaten path for them to do. Drugs are going to be there for ever and ever. They've been there since I was in school, so they're going to be there." 
"But my experience personally, I get speeding tickets. They're always nice. I just go pay them. I got arrested, so I've never been arrested."
"I've always thought, 'Ooh, that's horrible, they got arrested.' No. I was picked up by two federal Marshalls and three... Five people came to pick me up. That's important, I guess, because five people it took to pick me up." 
"When he had my file in front of me I said, 'What do you have in that file?' He said, 'Oh, you got a speeding ticket about a year ago.' That's it. That's all that was in my file, what people call your jacket." 
"I had the seatbelt put incorrectly so I pulled my hand out of the cuff so that I could fix the seatbelt, and I wouldn't be entrapped in it. The guy driving the car said, 'She took the handcuff off.' And I said, 'Oh, well, I'll just put it back on.'"
"They were nice to me. They did everything and pushed the paperwork through to make sure everything went through okay." 
"They were nice. That same arresting officer told a friend of mine in the sheriff's department that she would not have been accused, Kelly, if she had not done anything. Apparently you don't know things." 
"She said, 'I'm telling you this is not her.' So I saw the same gentleman not long ago, and he was extremely nice. He remembered me, and he told my friend she was right, that I was okay. So there are people like that." 
"My experience, I didn't have a bad experience, not even being booked. The worst experience I had was that they had a goofy nurse that when you made a request, she wouldn't come." 
"I didn't have it that bad but sitting in a jail gave me a different perspective, and being arrested gave me a different perspective." 
"I know how people feel when there's five people to come pick you up." 
"I know how that process worked, it worked the way it was supposed to." 
"Being chained and shackled, that's different. That's totally different."
"But even my cousin who is a police officer, he asked me how everything went to make sure that I was done okay." 
"My local sheriff's department was fine and so was the one they transferred me to. They transferred me across state line. It was all fine. They followed the book, they did everything. I didn't have a bad experience but I know that's not the way it always works." 
"I was compliant. I was very respectful. 'Yes, thank you, no, thank you.' They were kind to me. They were fine. And they had a bunch of people there."
".... afraid of them. What I am afraid of is if I'm out on my porch, and I'm wearing my hoodie, I'm letting my dogs out, I sometimes get paranoid that one of neighbors is going to call saying, 'There's a black guy in a hoodie around the porch.' They call the police." 
"I was trying to think, 'Where did come from? Is that coming from a media narrative?'"
"But then I think about when I was a young man growing up in the Twin Cities. I remember walking home one day in a hoodie and a police officer [inaudible] in... It was raining so that's why I had the hoodie up. The police officer pulled me over, asked me where I lived, if I knew where I was going, or if I belonged here. I was 13 at the time. I just remember thinking, 'I live here.'" 
"I asked my white friends if they've ever been pulled over or if they've ever been asked like that, and they said no."
"It was just one of those experiences that... And then I'm married to a white women so sometimes I'm not even thinking about it but she'll bring it up." 
"If we're at the grocery store, if we're walking our dogs down Milwaukee Street or something like that, she's worried that someone's going to identify me as someone that's... If I'm too far behind her, if she's ahead and I'm behind, she does get concerned that I'm too far behind her that someone might think I'm stalking her or attacking her or following her, and then might call the police." 
"She's always worried that we have to keep a certain distance."
"I'll jump in first. Number one, the people who approach someone who is walking down the road no matter what neighborhood they live in, that's a learned behavior." 
"We don't come into this world with that attitude and that behavior, we're taught. We're taught by everyone we're around. We're taught by what we see and what we read." 
"The media can change that concept, I believe. Working with other individuals, we can all as a group and with the media change that concept." 
"He has no business being afraid to walk down the road. His wife should be able to be proud of her husband. They should be able to relaxingly walk their dogs."
"I live in a very rural community and there are people who walk down the road. Well, I walked when I was growing up but I didn't go very far. But they walk down the road. So if you don't know these people in this small community then you have these leery things of, 'I wonder who that is? Did you lock the door before we left?'" 
"I don't lock my car door. You want my car, take it. I don't lock it. I taught a classroom of students. I saw nothing but students." 
"I can tell you how many girls and how many boys I had because the number of boys is always the most. But I taught students. That's appalling, the whole story that he's telling, the fact that he has to feel that way tears me up. It kills me. I can't stand it." 
"I made sure none of my students ever felt that way and not one of my three children would ever be that way. They have taught their children the same."
"You don't treat people that way. But it is learned. You're taught to be that way. You're taught to be paranoid, and you're taught to... It's small minded. It's like there is no tunnel." 
"I grew up and the community I live in is the community I grew up in. I came back here, don't ask me why." 
"But it's an all-white community. But it isn't anymore, so? I don't see, I just see people. I have tons of friends. I go to a church where everyone goes." 
"But I can't stand stories like that. I think more of those stories need to be told." 
"We need to know people are treated differently just by what they're wearing or just by what they look like." 
"We treat physically disabled people that you can see the disability, we treat them differently. But if you can't see that disability, you don't treat them differently."
"I had a teacher literally, a principal, who would not walk in my room because it made her cry to see my kids."
"And then I had another one (teacher) that didn't like to because she didn't want to be touched, so every time she came in my room, I made sure all my kids ran to her and grabbed her and touched her. You can't be that way, that's wrong. To me, that's wrong. You might as well live in a bubble. I can really go on and on about that. You need to shut me up."
"I'm 45 years old now and with what's going on with the world now, what's going on with the United States, I often think back when I was in the sixth grade, so that's was in 1986 here in Mobile at Scarborough Middle School. Scarborough Middle School was probably 50/50, 50% white, 50% black. I don't believe any kid at that school saw color. This has always stood out to me." 
"I've told the story many times over the years as this racism has shown its head over the last few years." 
"I'm pretty sure when this happened it was on Martin Luther King's birthday. She played Martin Luther King's speech for the classroom. I'll never forget this, that when she played that speech, I was a little closer to the front, I remember seeing her cry." 
"I never understood why she cried when that played until later in life. And I realized I never had experienced racism. I think the other kids in the classroom had never experienced racism. We didn't see what she saw when she was growing up." 
"I was very fortunate growing up that my father was a hospital administrator here in Mobile. For a while he worked the 3:00 to 11:00 shift at hospital, and I had a lady that looked out for us." 
"Louis was a black lady. When she came over to watch us every day, she brought her two sons that were the same age as me and my brother. I can't tell you how many nights did I grew up with them, spent the night with them, played with them. I never saw that."
"Later in life when I got into the army, the only color in the army when I was in the army was green. My very best friends in the army where a couple of black guys that were from... They were from Texas." 
"I think the media has played a lot into these last few years with racism. It's one of the worst... It's tearing this country apart because it takes so much to hate somebody." 
"It's so easy to love somebody and love your neighbors. It blows my mind that people can dislike somebody just because they don't like the color of their skin or for whatever crazy reason there is. I can't understand it, and I think I can understand it because my mind doesn't work that way."
"Two things are brought to mind. One is I had a very good friend growing up. We went to a predominantly white school, and she was black. She was actually the speaker at our high school graduation as well. We never thought of her as any different. It just wasn't hardly mentioned." 
"But she says recently that she remembers a situation where we had a music teacher that traveled to the different elementary schools, and they stopped playing Dixie because she asked them not to play it. Nobody really paid that much attention one way or the other as far as what color any of us were."
"Then on the hand it does work in reverse as I'm aware of a situation in an area that some black teen, early 20-something boys were harassing a sheriff's deputy, him and his wife in their front yard. Literally pulled off at the side of the road yelling and threatening them, which it works in reverse ways, both ways."
"Well, I can tell you. I've been in bail for more than 20 years, and my honest opinion, bail is pretty easy to access."
"Most people that are charged with a crime, that have only maybe been charged with a crime once or twice, been to jail once or twice, their family is going to help them in a situation to post bond." 
"A lot of times when people are stuck in jail are a repeat offender that has been in jail time and time and time again. It gets to the point that mom and dad say, 'We're not going to do it anymore. We want Joe Blow to learn a lesson.'" 
"I do believe there have been people that been put in jail for the wrong reasons. There's been times I've reached out and there's been many times that I've bonded people out of jail that I don't think they should be in jail at no charge. I'll always continue to do that."
"Bail bond companies not here just in Mobile, but I'm in constant communication with bail bond companies all through the state, a lot of bonding companies or they do try to help when an individual comes into a situation where they have been incarcerated." 
"A lot of bail bond companies go above and beyond to help families out. I know personally I've always done that. I know a lot of the other bail bond companies that are in business here in Mobile do that. There's a lot of good people that are in the bail bond business in the state of Alabama."
"I think this would be huge, I think, to help with the police department is having continued education. There's so many industries out here that require continued education for you to be in that particular industry. I don't know of a police department in this country that has continuing education requirements." 
"I think if police departments had a continuing education requirement to help them learn and grow every year, it would change the landscape of policing in our country." 
"I think it's an easy fix to implement something like that. I would hope that would be on the radar of discussion, having a continuing education. I just think that would go a long way to make policing better for the community as a whole."
"I guess more information to be available not just for the police, but there's times when people don't understand what they do." 
"If the public understood more what they do, what they're facing, and then I think they would have a little more understanding of, I guess, the approach that's made to certain instances, as well as be able to understand that they're just people too, just like you and I." 
"They do make mistakes. And then on the other hand they do great things as well. Maybe if both sides were shown it wouldn't be so much them against us. Maybe."
"I'd like to see somewhat some of the same... more educational opportunities." 
"I'd like to see their job be more appreciated." 
"I realize you're going to have a bad apple in the barrel no matter where you go. I didn't teach with everybody who was really good. I mean, it'd be honest with you, there were a lot of teachers who took that job because you got your summers off. They didn't care about your kids." 
"I'd like to see that. Knowing my cousin and his approach to the way things are, their pay. People need to understand that when a police officer dies there's no benefits for their family that's left out there. There's not a lot, especially if you're in a small community."
"Their job is probably the worst job that you could ever do. It's like the clean-up jobs in a hospital. Somebody's puked, you got to go clean it up." 
"To me, I'd like to see a little more understanding of the positions, understanding the law, and how that their job is to enforce that or to make sure that order is kept. I don't think people understand that. They just see them as someone who puts handcuffs on you or carries a gun." 
"That's the most infatuating part to a child, the uniform. It's more to it than that. It's a lot more to it. Their training needs to go physical with using whatever they have to use also."
"I don't think I know the question but what I think the answer is, is a ride-along for the media to be more involved and that firsthand perspective." 
"I think some of these groups that are anti-police, I think they need to come to these meetings and sit down with the police and maybe they should do a ride-along and the police reaching out to these groups and going and getting involved and getting into conversation." 
"I think we're very fortunate here in Mobile, very fortunate, the police chief, we have a direct or public safety that is very, very involved in the community. It's not just when a conversation comes up but they are involved in the community all the time." 
"I think we're very fortunate here in Mobile because of the level of involvement of the police department with the community."
"Absolutely. I mean, there's possibility for everybody to live in harmony. I would hope that we all teach our kids as they're growing up to love thy neighbor. And so absolutely there's a possibility of harmony. It takes everybody doing their part." 
"I truly believe there's good in everybody's heart. Sometimes I believe that to a fault, that I had to be shown so many times to see a negative in somebody's heart. But I think if we go in with the best of intensions, that we believe what the other side is saying and just listen, they could carry us some much farther." 
"But I truly believe that people have the best of intentions in their heart."
"How does the media plan to address issues, or is it a possibility that they could actually go to the police department before a media storm, for lack of a better term, and try to get some input from the police department rather than letting generically certain individuals or groups influence the media first before... technically go to the horse's mouth to get the information?"
"I would like to ask when it comes to the media and how they're reporting the information that they're asked to put out how much of that is controlled by those editors or those superiors who say they can only report this much and how far are they willing to go to put out what's true and what it is, even if it doesn't go along with that supervisor or whatever?" 
"I spoke with a girl from alabama.com, and she was literally told that she could not publish the article, and it came from the supervisor, but that came from a legislator who [inaudible] that she couldn't do that."
I think you should report true things. I think people need to be informed of everything that goes on. But there's some things that people can't handle. You just have to be realistic about certain things people can't handle.
"I think there's a huge possibility because it's like any relationship that you have, it requires work and effort on the part of each party, not just one. It has to be everybody is willing to try." 
"You're not always going to get a good result but I think everybody is willing to try. I don't see why you can't."
I think all parties can acclimate themselves to work in the same direction as long as all parties are willing to sit at the table and to come to a neutral agreement which is in the best benefit of all parties involved.
"This is a really neat thing to do. I think a lot more people need to get on board and do more and listen to what other people think and how they see things." 
"The state needs to be united. It doesn't need to be so divided, and it is divided. And I don't like that."
Are all the groups being asked the same questions? Or there are different angles that are being used?
"Like I said, my tendency in the past has been to be quiet, to be an observer, to not be involved in that since I have not sought justice, then maybe complacent to see certainly instances of justice that take place, and there are certainly instances of injustice. That's very easy to see." 
"So for my personal experience, I'm honestly having difficulty specifically... I mean, the one that jumps to mind is when... I mean, this is not personal, it's just what I remember. When Roy Moore had the Ten Commandments removed out of the courtroom, that was clearly the process of justice that everyone saw it and understood, under law, which I think it's important to note that justice is clearly not always within the bounds of law." 
"There are times that we have to seek to change the law in the pursuit of justice. I've got to think about that longer. Thank you."
"I'm a little bit like Shawn, in that I'm having a hard time coming up with a specific instance. My overall reaction is that I've been treated more than fairly throughout my entire life, due to my whiteness, and because of my background of privilege."
"I grew up financially comfortable, I came from a family of influence, I grew up with peers, went to school with people whose family had privilege, and the world was kind of greased in our favor. And so I didn't run into a lot of friction."
"And I'm not sure that that was always a good thing for me or for my peers, because we all need to... Eventually you're going to face the realities of the world at some point, regardless of what kind of privilege you come from." 
"Almost all of us, with the exception perhaps of Donald Trump, have to face our comeuppance at some point."
"But I know, even today, that I can drive any car I want, I can dress just about any way I want, and because of the way I present myself, and because of my whiteness, and because of my education and the way I can articulate my thoughts, and the way I interact with people based on that upbringing, that I'm going to be treated with a great deal of privilege." 
"Particularly just as a white male, forget about the privileged background, as a white male, when I walk into a room, I walk in holding two aces, and I know that my voice is going to be heard. And that's not fair. So I guess I'm answering your question from a little different point of view, but life has always been more than fair to me."
"We have a disparity in Huntsville of... I think it's 11 to 1. 11 times as many people of color are arrested for marijuana possession as white people. Well, that must me because black people smoke more pot than white people do, right? I seriously, seriously doubt that." 
"I think that it's simply the fact that we're not as policed as closely as people of color are." 
"Part of it has to do with probably the fact that there are fewer property crimes in white neighborhoods perhaps than their are in black neighborhoods, and so there's a greater police presence in black neighborhoods than there are in white neighborhoods, but there's also that bias where they're naturally looking at black people, particularly black males of a certain age, as threats and criminals."
"I would only mention with regards specifically to the question of policing in the community... My only observations are Community Watch programs that I have personally been involved with, otherwise it's 911 or the non-emergency phone number." 
"The Community Watch programs with police involvement in the community, I think it's great. I think people participate [inaudible 00:18:19]." 
"When I think about police involvement in the community, the first idealistic thought that pops into my head, optimistic thought that pops into my head is... There's a man on the basketball court, there's a police officer on the basketball court playing basketball with the kids. There's a YouTube video of that, maybe a couple of YouTube videos of that, but there's not near enough of that." 
"I think there has been a lot of people that [inaudible] that video, that experience, and it's a great thing, and that we need more of it, whether it's block parties or sporting events or just engagement with officers, especially into the communities that they serve and protect, that they function within." 
"Maybe I'm not aware of these events that are happening, but I would love to see more involvement especially for kids, with any kind of events that they can get involved in, just beyond the simple Community Watch programs, although [inaudible] those are good as well. Yeah, that's it."
"There's actually specifically something that I wanted to mention. Although yes, absolutely [inaudible] the positive experiences of policing in the community, because I am not aware of them, and I would love to be aware of them."
"But actually something else I was going to mention was the news coverage at the monument here in Huntsville. There is a thing that jumped out at me, that we've had reporters at the monument for various events, whether it was the Rosa Parks Day foundation rallies, plural, that they've done, or other community activist events at the courthouse, protest et cetera. And we typically see the same reporters, oftentimes we see similar faces."
"When the monument got defaced, just a few days ago, couple of weeks ago, there were new reporters that showed up that I have not seen cover any other... That I have not seen them at the monument events before. And it dawned on me, it stuck out to me, that it was... I don't know a delicate or careful way to say it." 
"The white reporters showed up when the monument was defaced, otherwise it was the black reporters that were showing up to cover [inaudible] events that were happening. That's what it appears to me. When it got defaced, suddenly it was a new set of reporters that came down, to cover that outrageous event, [inaudible 00:22:03]." 
"It makes me wonder if perhaps the removal of the monument is nearer and dearer to the hearts of those African American reporters, and I'm not going to suggest that there's any bias on the part of the white reporters, other than the fact that they're... I don't know. Do they have different beats? Are they all general assignment reporters? I'm not sure how that works." 
"I think he's talking primarily about television coverage, because of course we have four TV stations and only one real print medium here in Huntsville. But that's an interesting observation, Shawn."
"[inaudible] But the good part about [inaudible] as much excitement here in Huntsville as they do down in Birmingham."
"Until two months ago, I thought we were more like Mayberry, and I still do in some respects. I'm still shocked and dismayed by those horrible overreactions by local law enforcement on the 1st and the 3rd of June, but that doesn't really relate to your question, so I'll save that." 
"It's tough to cover as much as they have to with as few resources as I would imagine they have nowadays."
"And you got to do everything, right? It used to be that you had a photographer who shot the pictures and a writer who wrote the words, and you had this long layer of all this support staff and all, and now you're expected to do everything from soup to nuts."
"I'm just going to give you the short answer, and that is, I'm really not someone good to answer that question, because I honestly don't consume local media. When I say I don't watch local TV, I mean I watch absolutely no local TV." 
"Facebook. I will go off on that for just a minute. I'm involved in some organizations that are heavily weighted, some of them at least, towards an elderly population." 
"A lot of the folks who get up in their 60s and 70s and 80s, after they've retired, they have extra time on their hands, and they have social justice in their hearts, and they want to get involved and stuff. Unfortunately, many of them aren't on Facebook. And so it's hard for them to remain engaged." 
"I'm aware of this from having observed. Facebook, in my opinion, is sort of the daily newspaper of today. If you're not on Facebook, if you're not using it regularly, you don't really know what's going on in the community." 
"Even al.com, as good a job as I'm sure y'all do, are not covering everything that's going on on Facebook. I mean, if you want to know about the events that you might be interested in, you got to be on Facebook. I mean, that is the daily newspaper, and each one of us serves as individual reporters."
"Well, that's where the eyeballs are. How you do that and how you monetize it, I don't know. But that's certainly where the eyeballs are. That's where people are spending an inordinate amount of time. Instagram, all these others, I'm not sure about." 
"I'm in my 60s, and I've been engaged with Facebook for the last five years, re-engaged with Facebook because it is vital to the work that I do." 
"There's no way that I could be an effective community organizer without Facebook. And I just know that that's where I spend a lot of time, that's where I post a lot of the stuff that I read from the Washington Post and the New York Times, and from the New Yorker and other news sources, and that's where I interact with people." 
"And so if that's where the eyeballs are, then clearly that's someplace that you can tap into an audience."
"So I want to say for sure I'm very happy that the media was there to cover Chief McMurray, for instance, on June 4th, the day after the June 1 and June 3 protests downtown here in Huntsville. It was extremely beneficial coverage for me, for the public, I think, and I would assume for the police as well, right?" 
"They called a conference, I expect, so I assume that it met their needs. It definitely got information out to the public." 
"I feel like McMurray said some things that he didn't mean to say. He was asked questions that were tough questions, and by tough I mean great, good, very good questions, by members of the press." 
"And I think maybe we got some revelations about his true feelings, the way that he handles protests, as a result of the questions that the media asked. But I think that's a very positive experience."
"Otherwise, it's hard not to focus on these very provocative and important issues happening right now. In a more general sense, I think probably coverage of police tends to be very positive. I don't think there's been a lot of reasons to call them into question." 
"And I think the opposite, I think most people would want to see... I think there's an idea that people want to see positive news coverage about police, about how they are doing a great job, how they have gotten beneficial budget and have been getting more equipment to protect our community, which is great, the good positive coverage is good." 
"And I mean specifically before these protests were happening. Before these protests were happening, I don't think I've seen news coverage that was challenging to the police, and I would like to see more of that, as an unbiased process, unbiased analysis."
"Real time news. Oh, by the way, speaking of Dana Fletcher, weren't you the one that covered the thing for the awards that the police were going to get out in Madison? Major, major kudos for breaking that story."
"I won't say we're friends, but I know Paul Finley well enough that when we run into each other we have private conversation." 
"I for the first time wrote him an email that Sunday night, and said, 'Are y'all asleep out there? Have you lost your minds? Are you not paying attention to what's going on, not only here locally but across the country and around the world? How in the world could you have thought this was a good idea?'" 
"And without you having gotten that email and broken that story, they probably would have gone ahead with those awards. Not that it makes any difference one way or the other, they revealed their cards, we saw their hand when they said they were going to do that. What is with people? Anyway..."
"[crosstalk] I've seen a family in tears recently, as a result of that coverage, and it's hard, it's hard for them, and it's also so, so necessary, so needed."
"Sure. So specifically, my experience, it's part of the Northeast Huntsville Civic Association, and they had scheduled I guess some representatives from the police to show up and talk about their Community Watch program." 
"I believe that on the Nextdoor app I've seen advertisements for their Community Watch program, but I have not attended those. But in the Civic Association, when they invited the representatives, the police did show up. Two officers showed up to talk about their Community Watch program." 
"So it's a limited experience. I'm not so personally interested in Community Watch. I appreciate it, I like it, I don't feel so much of a need for it, I just would like to see more..." 
"Very glad that the Civic Association reached out to the officers to come speak about it, but I definitely would like to see more outreach and involvement in the community when possible."
"I absolutely appreciate the points you guys are making there. My social media involvement has been... Like I said, I've always been quiet in the past, and not been involved, but absolutely, social media does have a role to play in media." 
"I think it makes perfect, brilliant sense that that would be an exercise arm of media coverage. It's sort of like... Like Wikipedia is sourced. I'm sorry, there's a name for that that I'm not coming up with." 
"We trust Wikipedia because everybody has editing rights, everybody covers it, so enough people will get in there and create truthful Wikipedia entries. So having that same sourced coverage of media through social media, it sounds very much needed and necessary."
"Speaking from my experience [inaudible] Twin Cities, we all know racism is everywhere. But coming from the Twin Cities, where it truly is a melting pot, I never blatantly experienced racism there." 
"I'm 23 years old, I loved Madison, and it was the first time that someone had called me a gook to my face. And I just turned and looked at my friend, I was like, 'Does this happen here?' We were on State Street, and I was just like, 'Does this really happen?'" 
"And the police officer there... We're having a conversation, and I said, 'Did he really just say that to me?' And he goes, 'Yeah, I really just called you a gook.' And there was a police officer right there, and all he does is he turns to me and my friend, and he says, 'You guys, go that way or go that way, now.'" 
"A white police officer. And I was like, 'This guy called me a derogatory term, and you're telling me I need to go this way or this way? You're not even going to address what happened here?' And he said, 'This way or that way, or I can take you in that car.' And that was the end of that conversation. So we just turned and we left. So for me..."
"I'm feeling this deep disturbance in my soul by having heard that." 
"So I'm getting a view of Madison first through Muriel and Lauren's eyes, and now through this... I presume she's an Asian American... eyes, who was spoken to in a derogatory manner by somebody." 
"My immediate thought is, the person who spoke to her in that manner was expressing his... He was using his First Amendment right to free speech, and so I'm not sure exactly what the policeman could have done, other than to have scolded him, which I don't know if it has any authority of law." 
"His concern sounded to me like he wanted to break it up and keep them away from each other, rather than feeding the fire by getting in the midst of it. He was trying to protect the young woman being spoken to in such an awful fashion." 
"That may be my white privilege. I may be looking at it through my white privilege lens."
"I think [inaudible] as well as in just aggressively acting. There needs to be a understanding in addressing members of the community, and root and source causes that would begin and start violence, as opposed to just simply coming in and frankly instigating aggression and violence, or perpetuating aggression and violence." 
"To me, it highlights an extreme need to change our policing trainings and methodologies. We absolutely have to change the way that we police this country, I think."
"[crosstalk] I'm not... Ashley and... Star, is that her name? Star Reporter , is that the nickname she goes by? They're the ones that I've had the most contact with this summer, and they've both been very responsive." 
"I can't think of any holes right off-hand." 
"Frankly, and this is really shameful given my background and my history, because not only was I in the newspaper business but my father was as well, I should be more critical, and I should have specific answers for you, but honestly, I've kind of thrown up my arms long ago, and I take what I get, and am grateful for it, from al.com." 
"I have very mixed feelings about it. I grew up at the Birmingham News, literally grew up at the Birmingham News. I've in the past known the owners of the company. And so my soul is connected with the organization in some ways. I'm grateful that they're still here, because without them, I'm not sure who would fill the void, frankly, but there's so much missing."
"Here's what I want to see happen. I want to see everybody to enjoy the same privilege as I have. It's not pie. I'm not going to give up anything." 
"Perhaps my voice won't be quite as loud when I'm speaking in the room, but I'll get to hear the points of view of other people. People of color and different genders and different sexualities will be more evenly heard, and it'll be a more colorful, balanced conversation."
"So I would like to say, to answer that question, I feel like we definitely need media coverage to not be concerned of non-bias." 
"I think that there's a way that we can address that without fear or concern of losing our objectivity. There's so much concern about, well, we have to be non-biased. And I understand that to a degree, but I definitely want to give my strong feeling that..." 
"For instance, like the officer addressing the man that was saying derogatory things. The officer needs to show some bias in that situation, if that's what you call it, if you call it bias." 
"Because it needs to be recognized that the man speaking derogatorily is not acceptable. That's not a statement of bias, that is a statement of civility in our civilization. And I think our media absolutely needs to encourage civility as well, it's a foundation and cornerstone of our society."
"And it has been extremely concerning, extremely alarming, in the last few years, the platform that Donald Trump has received, and the normalization of his rhetoric, as a degradation of our civil society." 
"And I think it's been stated by many people, the concern that our media has given as, 'Well, he's got a equal, valid point, so we give him an equal, valid platform that we give the other politicians.'" 
"[inaudible] ... media to cover that, but I feel like we have to encourage media to represent [inaudible] of the country and be stronger in calling out people that are not working for [inaudible] and community for the country [inaudible] can do that. That is what I desperately want and need... [inaudible]"
"Specifically criminal justice reform because, and police reform, because interactions with police have great consequences that go beyond violence and death." 
"...that PTSD and the ongoing trauma that people carry with that, the ongoing financial trauma that people carry if they have an interaction with police that causes court cases, it just adds to poverty and so many other difficulties that some people face that addressing this issue will address several issues."
"So I've seen the bad, I've seen the good. I've seen the problems. And because of that interest, I've been tracking what's been going on in Huntsville with law enforcement for the past few years. And I'm seeing some disturbing trends." 
"I'm seeing some issues that are not being addressed. And I'm seeing some things in the statistics around crime in Huntsville that are disturbing and very telling of some deeply rooted problems and issues that I feel are not being addressed."
"So a lot of times, we stand in places that are uncomfortable for the people we may be advocating against, or opposing because of their views or their stance or their lack of action towards justice." 
"And in a recent occasion during one of those events, the actual, I'm actually going to relate it to a police officer just because they kind of enforce laws and supposed to be purveyors of justice and such. So they actually reached out to me, I had a conversation with them and we discussed the legalities of where we were standing. We also discussed noise ordinance and things of that nature."
"So during that particular protest, even though the objects of the protest and the demonstration weren't happy with our being there, the officer recognized that we were within our first amendment constitutional rights and supported us and actually provided coverage as we left the area since there wasn't a area to actually walk over sidewalk, provided coverage, privacy okay, or allowed us to exercise our first amendment right without disrupting us or preventing us from being able to do that." 
"This is a very hard question. I don't think I've ever thought about receiving justice." 
"I've always been an advocate for it. But I'm trying to decide, I guess, I mean, I've been in situations in my workplace, where I was mistreated. And in the past, in previous employment situation, when I spoke up about it, I've been taught to, if you see something is wrong, you say something about it." 
"But in this most recent situation, I basically brought it to someone's attention." 
"I stood within my boundaries of being right or what have you. And the management team came behind me and stood behind what I had stated." 
"And so there was fairness and justice because the other person was out of line. And so their response was impartial but it sided on my bad."
"So when you ask the question, it's hard for me to contrast it with not receiving justice because I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I felt I didn't receive justice." 
"Mr. Bowden mentioned something I can relate to having actually been involved in a few protests and counter protests. So I've had some of the same experiences there." 
"But, there's so many things where there have been instances where it could have not gone my way, that I feel I received justice." 
"In fact, I think justice kind of bent my way in some circumstances because of who I am, the position I was in. So I would say, I think I've felt throughout my life, it's always tilted in my favor if I really reflect on it."
"This one is more of a conversation on fairness. And it's funny, we're here talking about coverage when things kind of unfolded in early June, and we sought to report them, not dot com by any means, but some other outlets even went so far as to only quote the police chief and the mayor and the response for their articles." 
"And in terms of fairness, some people have kind of gone back to the mean of reporting both sides. So it's nice to see that fairness distributed in just daily coverage."
"So there was a shooting by somebody at this location, I'm looking for more of a story, I'm digging into more of the what happened and maybe why, based on the information that's available." 
"But we tend to now get media coverage that's more sensationalized just to get people to click on things, and then people argue about it on social media." 
"But as far as law enforcement, I think that what they do well, for me, I had an experience where I made a comment about a situation, about a shooting, and the law enforcement, I was able to go to a training, a shoot don't shoot training as a response of comments that I made, with the help of a city council person, but still, the police training Officer captain was willing to allow me to go as a civilian. So that was something they were responsive."
"And what I learned there is that they have a lot of burdens that are beyond their area of expertise as it relates to mental health calls and social disturbance calls that they're not equipped to deal with and to have the captain to admit to that was refreshing." 
"Because they understand that that's not what they're trained to do, but they have to deal with it because of the way our society is currently structured." 
"So that's one gap that they have, where they're filling roles that social workers and mental health specialists should be fulfilling, but because we have limited funds across the state, they're forced to handle those types of situations."
"I guess I have one. One of the roles that I guess they fill, since they're normally first on the scene, they do provide a level of medical help, I guess, first aid, CPR." 
"I have a friend who's my childhood friend. He's a police officer, and he's been an officer for probably as long as I've been a developer, so about 20 years. And a lot of times they arrive to the scene before anyone else as it relates to emergencies." 
"So they fill in the gap for the EMT, I guess would be another way of saying that, they fill in the gap there because they provide emergency medical response on the spot while they wait for the actual EMT and the other medical professionals to show up. So I guess that's a positive that they provide."
"For me, they fill in the gap of, when we have no one else to call for certain major situations. That for me, that's their main function." 
"I've seen them as Remus said, providing EMT, which they do receive proper training for their role there until the EMTs arrive. I've seen them changing tires on the side of the parkway." 
"Things that we could maybe better outsource, they're just not fully equipped and trained to handle all of these things throughout the day. I mean, you're asking a single human to be trained for 30 jobs. And, we need to work on a way to revise that. And I think everyone would benefit from that, those are my thoughts."
"I think there's a lot of times that officers are asked to do things that are out of their skill set, necessarily. One that hasn't been mentioned is domestic relations counselor." 
"So many calls are related to domestic situations." 
"I can think of times when there's been good outcomes and bad outcomes. A lot of that is based on the officers own personal experience for their own personality." 
"They're not selected for that. When they do well, I think they can be applauded for that." 
"But again, I think we do ask a lot that really aren't within the role of the police." 
"Changing tires was mentioned. I've been in so many places. After leaving Florida, I've lived literally across the country. And in some areas, you'll see a lot of these things have already been outsourced. They've been outsourced for 30, 40 years." 
"And in general, I would say there's a high correlation between good citizen interaction with police when those things have been outsourced. We don't have that in Huntsville, just as an observation." 
"And we have, I believe his last name is Hollingsworth is our crisis prevention officer, and they are moving to properly train officers." 
"Well, properly trained officers for these kind of mental health negotiations, things of that nature. But when a life is on the line, you need a person that their job is dedicated to that and nothing else." 
"We don't need people with 30 jobs showing up to save or to try and attempt to save a life when there training is a conflict between a crisis prevention training. So it's something we need to take a hard look at."
"And also, just from a simple budget standpoint, I think social workers should be paid more, absolutely. But at the end of the day, a police officer is paid much higher." 
"And so we're sending these people out to handle things. And then we're paying them that to handle things that could be done for a lower cost for the city that we could put back into our community, but also a safer situation all at all if we sent a social worker, someone who does this for a living, to go out there and handle these things."
"Apparently, the house had been listed illegally on Zillow, is the website. And I saw other people drive by later in the day looking at the same house. I had to tell them, since I was on the porch that, hey, it's actually not for sale." 
"However, the officer sits there, runs all their information. I'm not sure what for, he could have just asked him to leave. This could have been a two minute endeavor."
"And then a second officer pulls up. And then a third officer pulls up. And this is for a man half my size, a pregnant wife and two toddlers looking at a home. And it just seems like a waste to me, both from a budget standpoint, a waste of the family's time. I just don't know why we allocated three officers all in brand new Ford 2020 SUVs to show up to that scene."
"For me, my concern is the lack of accountability with our law enforcement agencies, no one should be above the law. And there is no job." 
"And so we have built our law enforcement agencies to be 100% correct, 100% of the time. So that's concerning." 
"The push toward more militarization, we have tanks, we have hammers, yet we claim to also have low levels of crime is concerning." 
"Objectifying individuals, objectifying citizens, and to create a wall of us versus them where we're supposed to be all collaborative in a community is concerning, and placing the behavioral health responses in their hands when they are not equipped and they're trained to give violent responses." 
"They're not trained to, and then to add a little speckle of de escalation or a speckle of social soft skills is not adequate."
"And so those are things that are concerning to me, because we are a human race. We should all see each other as humans." 
"Officers are suffering from PTSD. People who have had encounter with officers are suffering from PTSD." 
"And so you have these groups of pockets of society suffering from PTSD going untreated, and then having encounters, this should escalate because of all of these underlying factors."
"I guess as far as interactions, to chime in on, or piggyback on what Angela said, as well as what Josh said as well, the encounters that I've had have always, unfortunately have mildly escalated." 
"There have been some that haven't, but most times is they don't approach the citizens as citizens, more like children, as if they're to be respected above and beyond the respect that they're giving the people that they're actually interacting with." 
"I don't know if it's a complex or what the issue is, but I think a lot of it surely has to do with the levels of PTSD that they have from working the job and seeing tragic events. Also, something that was mentioned, that was truly disturbing."
"But the chief, I guess, alluded to the fact that the virtual training modules here have a higher percentage of black males as the perpetrators of crimes in their training modules. I think the number was close to 80% or 85%. Now, that's extremely disturbing." 
"As a black male, first of all, because, I mean, if you're programming and conditioning your officers to view people who look like me as your typical perpetrator of violence, your typical perpetrator of crime, it makes sense why they don't have a problem, and it's not as hard for them to fire upon us."
"I think for the same reasons that our parents or my mom. When I was younger, hey, don't watch all of those violent movies. Try not to play many violent video games. It desensitizes you as a person." 
"And the lack of empathy on top of the lack of sympathy upon just desensitizing of our police force by showing them stereotypical, playing into the stereotypes of who are the purveyors of violence and crimes in our community, especially well, in any community." 
"But here based on the numbers that I quoted before, is disturbing. And is a cyclical process that's going to continue. Black people are going to continue to be brutalized by cops because they don't see us as equal or citizens or their lack of engagement with the community is evident."
"And as evident as it is, is not a surprise, right? People tend to just naturally show empathy towards people that look and maybe remind them of someone else in their family." 
"So when they're looking at me, if they don't have black friends or don't have community engagement, when they look at me, I'm essentially the same person that they've seen in their training module. Even though I've gone to school, I'm a working professional, I'm a parent. I don't break laws." 
"But when they see me even if it's on a traffic stop, they're hypersensitive. They're on edge. They're on alert. And they're ready for something to escalate, that really has no potential of escalating."
"Their approach to how they interacted and engaged people were different." 
"If you show up with your gun, pull, or if you show up with your holster popped and ready to pull your gun and draw your gun on a traffic stop, I don't know what else they wouldn't be expecting from the incident, right, if you show up prepared for that." 
"So my experience has always been, I've always been forced out of the car." 
"I think in the last 20 years, there's been one traffic stop where I've gotten a warning. And that was when I was taking my daughter to the airport back in, almost a year ago, very first time I've ever gotten a warning from a police officer." 
"Most times I'm pulled out of the car. I'm having to stand beside the car while they take their time to run my license, while they take their time to run my plates. While they ask me all kinds of questions that aren't related to the reason that they stopped me."
"And that's an ongoing thing. And I think, in Huntsville community, as it relates to our police, they say their average age is around 25." 
"So that's problematic in itself. Not that age is a problem, but 25, high school diploma, not a lot of training, not a lot of engagement." 
"I mean, if you didn't go to... So what we're saying is, if you didn't go to high school with black people, or people of other races, then you're out of the game, right?" 
"Because now you've gone from high school, to now your career, and you still haven't had an opportunity to interact with people that don't look, don't behave, don't share the same, maybe not share the same culture as you."
"So it creates this process that we're going to continually deal with because of the lack of funding that's going towards training." 
"Because of the lack of engagement that these officers are required to have, so they're unfamiliar with the people they're policing." 
"So their unfamiliarity makes them fearful of the people they're policing, which creates a situation where people are getting killed and shot for really close to nothing. Even trying to follow commands. So I don't know." 
"It's a mountain of things that really needs to be done to further make policing a safer engagement for everyone."
"It was a lot to unpack there. I'm going to throw out one piece of data, I'm kind of a data guy. Black man is likely to be shot by a black officer as a white officer, and I think there's a systemic problem that's behind that. And it has to do with field training. So officers get academy..."
"I mean, I have some police, some HPD and some Sheriff Department friends, that, most of them live out in the county. So you have a situation where you went to school, you grew up in a predominantly white area, and then you further distance yourself from that, and then you drive into these communities that don't look like you." 
"And then you have the authority aspect, you're given a gun, and it's just hard to find where that's an even balance of relation, an understanding to the local community." 
"I know we have community events that are hosted by our police force, but I don't quite think that's the level that we need to reach out. I think we need to go above and beyond."
"And also, some kind of incentive to live in your community that you're policing. I mean, you see this nationwide. And it's a huge issue for people that can't really relate, that are not given opportunity, they just haven't chosen, I don't know." 
"But we need more officers that can relate to the communities they're policing."
"Okay, good. So to get back to what I was saying. There's a big disconnect between the training and officer preseason in the academy and the field training they receive." 
"Training Day. That scenario is extreme, but it's not that uncommon. Officers go on the job. The Field Training Officer instills a lot of things in them that they didn't get in the academy and they're not all positive. Not at all." 
"I think I did get through when I mentioned that black officers are just as likely to shoot a black suspect as white officers are, and we know that that happens disproportionately. The reason is police culture, and police culture, to put it bluntly, is white supremacist." 
"But yes, all the stressors are there for officers, but they have been introduced into a culture that is racist." 
"The other thing about the age. So, when you were mentioning that the age is around 25, there's a lot of turnover. There is a tremendous amount of turnover in policing for a lot of different reasons." 
"But I'm going to say, I did go on a rant when McMurray was appointed Chief. I think it hit well. Let me think about how I want to put this. I think he typifies the ill prepared leadership in most police departments. And that's, again, it's just seniority." 
"Now, I think there's another aspect there that we could get into later, talking about politics. But militarization was mentioned, I think it's certainly a factor." 
"But I think the recent examples we've seen have shown that the city administration intends for the police department to have the primary role of reinforcing the political status quo in a hyper partisan environment."
"And I have to go back to our own mayor's history, our mayor's politics to understand why McMurray of all the captains, of all the captains, why he was promoted when he ran the worst precinct, the worst precinct for crime rate." 
"And we could get into crime rate. The crime rate in Huntsville is under reported, and it's under reported in part because of the press relations with the police department." 
"And too often the media is just accepting what the police department says when I've looked at the data. And what's in the FBI's Uniform Crime reports is a lot worse than our police department portrays it. So there's no transparency there, and there's no accountability there." 
"That's got to be addressed. And it isn't going to be addressed until there's more media coverage of it, and more people are outraged by it."
"To wrap up there, In terms of transparency, we don't even know our use of force policy. To my knowledge, I haven't been able to find it. And it hasn't been released." 
"We don't have crime maps, whether that's used for their strategic purposes or not, we should have that available." 
"And furthermore, I'd like to, this is just a critique, but if we're going to buy 2020 Ford SUVs for all these officers when we can get a Toyota Camry built here in Huntsville for half the price." 
"Can we maybe get some kind of... I assume they come with GPS. I mean, it is 2020. So maybe we get some kind of heat map of where they're patrolling and maybe try and revise over patrolled communities, and see what's going on with that. But the public needs to see all of this. I shouldn't have to make eight calls to get the budget."
"I will say for me, I used to love Charlene Stevens in his watchdog reports. That is, every time he did a report, it seemed like it shined a light on the fact that Huntsville was not as progressive and was quite racist." 
"I mean, we saw disparities that people were dismissed. When a certain segment of the population talks about disparities that are in Huntsville, there are other segments of the population that say, oh, they just don't know what they're talking about. They're just angry for no reason." 
"And so when his watchdog reports would come out, it was like, here we have data improve of the truth. So I used to love those." 
"I was grateful for the article that aol.com did after Chief McMurray's three hour presentation about the protest where they actually fact checked what he said, that's a rarity, it seems nowadays because people are afraid of, I don't know, losing advertising dollars is the only thing that I could think of. So those were some good times."
"Yeah, I think again, at first, it seemed that a few organizations were not doing their due diligence, with the exception of aol.com of course." 
"But as Angela stated, they really went through and just nailed every single, anything that was kind of up for question or anything, their fact checking process was spot on. We've started to see more of that." 
"I mean, early on when things kind of, I can't speak for the past few years, but I know just being there, June 1st through 3rd and pretty much every day after that, we've slowly seen several organizations try to get things more accurate. And, they've actively sought to develop a relationship with the reformed community."
"So, in that regard, it seems that people are trying, but we want to continue to see a fair and balanced viewpoint, and a fact checked viewpoint, because when you go up on a podium and live for three hours, it's pretty easy to find the answers."
I've seen a definite improvement in coverage but there needs to be more in depth in individual crime stories for one thing. What's illuminating when you look at a crime story is...
"I guess on a positive note, the media did do a great job to piggyback on what Josh said, of holding accountable the statements that were made by the chief." 
"So I think that was actually good that we were able to hold him accountable. I think we, of course, could do more of that." 
"I think there are a lot of instances where, I don't know, but there's a lot of... Man, when stories are presented, it leaves the question or it leaves a person in a position to wonder what crime the actual person committed versus the pictures that you're seeing." 
"And a lot of times people who look like me or when they commit lesser crimes, people of color end up with a larger story or larger, they take up a larger segment of the advertising or the space that's used to create these stories."
"I think the media could do a better job at that at least covering and presenting these facts more equally." 
"I mean, there's a man who, I mean, the example that's floating around now is a more recent one, but typical of kind of what you see in the media's coverage of black men is you have a black man who was accused of carjacking. However, you have a story next to it, and the story of the black man who carjacked someone or whatever the case may be, a lesser violent crime, has taken up a huge landscape of the actual media feed there." 
"Image is humongous, the title is smaller. But the way it's all framed, is framed in such a way that more attention should be paid to this particular person's crime versus another person's crime."
"And whether it is delivered, maybe it's the media that they received for this particular story, I don't know."
"But the fact that the size of the image that's representing the crime of a person who committed a lesser offense type crime versus someone who actually took lives, one, multiple or whatever, and their image being smaller, the coincidence that that smaller images of a white man versus the larger image of a black guy who may be jacked a car, carjacked or was involved in a carjacking." 
"It plays out too often, whether it's local media, national media, I think unfortunately, it's a part of this whole systemic racism that we're fighting hard to defeat. And that is instantly labeling and creating this narrative that's perpetuating systemic racism, where people are kind of given two choices."
"And unfortunately, one of the major choices that they get is to feed into implicit biases that they already have that has already been fed to them." 
"And either fear mongering tactics by the media, or by our government, right, because there were no super predators as it related to white people. There were no white super predators. That terminology was created for black males." 
"So I think the media should be more, they should be more resistant to falling in line with the rest of the outlets when it comes to how they cover the crimes and the people equally, so that we're not always continually casted in this role of humanity as the perpetrators of violence. The perpetrators that should stroke fear within people when they see us."
"Going back to what Chris was saying, yeah, black people are just killed more often than anybody, whether it's by black cop or a white cop." 
"And that's all a part of how this country has created this narrative towards the black man and who he is, what he represents, and how he's been used to tokenize fear, he's been used to tokenize this violent, over sexualized, fear mongering tactic that unfortunately our government perpetrates and our media picks that up and sing the same song without thinking about the damage that that creates."
"That forces people like me to buy cars that I really don't want to buy so that I don't have encounters with police officers. I bought a hybrid. I call it my tree hugger love bug."
"I bought that car explicitly, and I lightly tinted the windows explicitly to avoid interactions with police, period."
"I've owned nice cars before. I made it a point to stop buying nice cars because I found myself getting pulled over non stop." 
"So unfortunately, myself, and I'm sure other black males included and other black people included, are forced to do things to preserve their life, which other races have no reasoning or haven't even considered having to do just because the diceyness of having an interaction with a police officer for me is not worth it."
"I mean, I rather have good gas mileage and get a car that commutes and gets me where I need to go without having any kind of interaction with a police officer." 
"And I don't think that's, I mean, obviously, it's not right. It's not fair that I should have to curve and make choices to keep myself safe from the people who are really supposed to keep me safe." 
"And unfortunately, I think we really have to be careful because I think the media also feeds into that narrative." 
"And I don't know where I ended up. I feel like I went into my soapbox as well, which I didn't really want to." 
"But still, I think that those are, as it relates to how we're represented in the media, how we're represented by the government. And by we, I mean people of color, especially black men." 
"Especially, especially, explicitly black men, how we're perpetrated in the media is completely unfair."
"And for media outlets that do try and give us a fair shake, they're considered far left or hyper liberal media, and that needs to change overall, the fairness and how media and cop interactions is reported." 
"And what actually goes on in these communities, there's a ways to go, for sure." 
"Because what we're doing now, unfortunately just feeds into the narrative that we're criminals, we're drug dealers, we're gang bangers, we're all of these negative things, the light that we get for doing positive, especially in the media and just in the public is a minimum. A minimum." 
"I'm sure we could probably think of a story right now as to a negative interaction with a police officer or a negative story as it relates to how black people are perpetrated in the media, and we probably can't think of."
"I mean, think of just even your first question, how long it took for myself, took for Angela, to come up with the..." 
"All right, man was a just situation where justice was render." 
"I mean the fact that it takes time to go through and think about that is evidence of how far we have to go when it comes to policing equality, how the media perpetuates stereotypes about us."
"I think there's a lot of stereotyping going on." 
"And I think there's a perfect example that has occurred over the last few months since June. So in parallel with the police riot that happened in June, there were several instances of Neo-Nazi graffiti being put on synagogues, locally here in Huntsville." 
"Now while Chief McMurray and the media is complicit in this, because they didn't cover those instances in the depth that they need to be, because while Chief McMurray was calling out anti fascist and anarchist and using all the right wing, buzzwords, demonizing, dog whistle call outs, there is reliable intelligence, not the kind of intelligence that McMurray used, which was to dig around social media to find somebody to blame." 
"Reliable intelligence, about five active Neo-Nazi groups in this part of Alabama, there are five, they've been ignored."
"The media has ignored them, McMurray has ignored them. And it's been written off as, it's just a little graffiti. Well, it starts with just a little graffiti. And now those Neo-Nazis have been given permission." 
"They've been given permission by our national government. They've been given permission now by our local government to act as they will. There's is no effort to infiltrate those groups by our local police. There's no coverage of that. It's as if it doesn't exist. But it's a very real threat. And we're ignoring those real threats." 
"I want to get back to something Mr. Roberts said while my setup here wasn't working. And that is, you talked about transparency in terms of seeing the use of force policy and those things, that's going to have to be addressed by the legislature."
"My experience in Florida, having to answer for your request is very different than being on the other side of that in Alabama." 
"By law in Alabama, police records are not subject to FOIA, they can stonewall you on anything, and that's got to be changed by legislature, unfortunately we have, well, I'm going to get partisan here. We've got a republican supermajority, and it's not going to change." 
"It's not going to change until our politics change. And one thing I hope to see out of these discussions in the long term is a lot more community, political engagement, a lot more outrage about these things that get people to turn out and vote." 
"When we have 30, 40% voter turnout. We've got a minority of a minority determining the future of Huntsville and the future of Alabama. And that's got to change or we're going to continue to go down this path." 
"We're going to continue to have these conversations, and the media could do a lot to change that."
"I mean, to add to this is, I think in Huntsville, I think we actually have a sub 30% voter turnout on average. And I think for our last run off, we had a sub 15% voter turnout." 
"I mean, COVID might have something to do with that, voter suppression certainly also does. But to talk back about your comments on McMurray with ANTIFA situation, it's even worse than you might think. So there were national alerts sent out to every law enforcement agency in the country proclaiming that ANTIFA would be busted. I mean, 88,000 departments, everyone got this. McMurray took that as fact and decided that that was all he needed to act how he acted. He didn't read the room. He didn't look at Huntsville and say, oh, this is Huntsville. Anybody that reads into this, I mean, they know that there is a such thing as ANTIFA, it's like a few people in the Pacific Northwest. I mean, there is no real organized Southern ANTIFA that has any threat, and even if there were, their name is anti fascists. So I don't really see a huge issue there, but they were not there that day. So you have a police chief that's openly lied at Council."
"And something that Remus touched on earlier is, black Americans being targeted by police at a far higher rate." 
"It goes into not only a racial bias and things of that nature, but I had to explain to several family members, if you have two police officers on your street everyday you pull out of your driveway, you're probably going to get targeted more often than not, as opposed to, for instance, the South Precinct where you have trouble seeing the cops sometimes." 
"So, cops are the police in general. I mean, if they're more around you, it's more likely that you will be targeted. We got to look at that and figure out a correct revision to that, because people are getting, some unfair things are happening."
"Also with media coverage, something that Remus also mentioned earlier, and I just wanted to say my comments early, media coverage is not perfect." 
"It seems that there is a small increase in coverage, but it is nowhere near what it needs to be with the info that needs to be presented as well, you usually see like a little snippet of something, maybe like a paragraph or two that's very... I mean, it's just the basics and not really the full story." 
"And I understand that a full story couldn't entail an opinion piece, but there's ways to do that without being biased." 
"You want to present as many facts as possible so that people have the information. Otherwise, you might be framing a narrative."
"I think everybody has said it. The type of stories that are covered and is there a true investment in the community that is the reporters and then the news papers are or the media is covering or is it how much of it is driven by ratings?" 
"I mean, I know what their newspapers being are going out of business and things like that. That's a concern but it seems like back in the day a Walter Cronkite and all those individuals, the goal was to report factual truthful in depth information." 
"And that seems to have gone by the wayside and like you say it seems like there's a few that are worth researching, but where is the objective in investigative reporting, there are obvious things that are contradictory that people say in the midst of a press conference, and they never even get questioned about it." 
"So it's like now what is the purpose of news media? And then we wonder why people don't trust the media. Well, they have some valid reasons."
"I'm going to just jump in and say bring Charlene back. No, bring back the watchdog report. Bring up concerns." 
"I'm sure you guys see the comment thread of every post that sort of a free for all now, if there's some ongoing themes in there, do the reporters take, hey, this is something that we need to address and do a story on it, just be connected with the community to help share the truth, I mean, the objective truth, and not to favoring one side or the other, but just to put the truth out there and not be afraid that people are going to boycott you because you're sharing the truth. That's what I would like to see." 
"And take an active role in the community if the paper is actually a part of the community." 
"Lead some discussions that are going to push the needle versus citizens doing what they do and then the newspaper reported on it, become an active partner in it, which I think this is a step in that direction. And I'll be done."
"[crosstalk] When, where and why? I don't see the why. I look at aol.com, there's never the why." 
"There is a very brief factual report on most crime stories and never the why. The why is where the media is. And we need to see that, some more investigation." 
"I'd certainly like to see coverage or opinion pieces on the what, on the why the police responded to the demonstrations in June. I have already given my opinion, but I think that needs to be covered." 
"Because that is not only a crime story, it's a political story. And it needs to be uncovered. So that's the main things I would say there." 
"The other thing is, Angela mentioned where there's comments. Well on the aol.com site now, there's no comments. And I congratulate you for that. Taking that comment section out really improves the readability of that site."
"But I looked over at your Facebook page, and the Facebook page, there's still comments. It looks like it's maybe moderated somewhat, but I don't read that Facebook page." 
"But I looked at it yesterday before this call, and I had to scroll down through, well, I lost count of the number of stories, I had to scroll down to, to see anything meaning other than COVID, COVID, COVID." 
"Okay, that's an important story. But to find any crime related story. And what I find, I found, oh, well, what is the Montgomery going to do about enforcing COVID restrictions?" 
"Now tell me, if I read that I'd say there's no crime in Alabama. It's a completely false picture."
"Now I understand you're driven by getting clicks and you want people to see the ad revenue." 
"And the one criticism I have on the website itself is the layout. And when you read a story. So if I'm reading a crime story, or a news story, I'll see off to my right hand side of the screen, I'll see additional stories. But I've noticed something, story, Clickbait story, ad, story, Clickbait, story, ad. It's counter to the purpose of a newspaper." 
"So I think really aol.com's got to decide, are you news media? Are you social media? Because right now it's neither it's neither fish nor fowl, and it really serves no other purpose than to drive ad revenue."
"I will say that these are businesses. They are news outlets. We've seen decreased viewership, decreased subscriptions, and a lot of these instances. So I think that's why we have this influx of ads." 
"However, there are ways it could be, maybe we have it on the sides, instead of in between articles." 
"Maybe, I don't know, let's look at all the options, but there are ways we can better that situation." 
"And also I just want to say the comments sections in these local, oh boy, I mean, it's like a QA on manuscript or something like that. And it has been since I've been alive."
"I know everyone has a business agenda here. But this is a very, I mean, this moment isn't going anywhere, and we need to be covering it day in and day out, as essentially a lead story or at least in the top three." 
"I mean, there's just no excuse for our current movement moment not to be covered in a certain manner."
"Well, there is a reason and that's because they don't want to hear it or see it." 
"I mean, if the media represents even a microcosm of the citizens in our city, just based on the feedback that I get standing on the corner holding a sign, the one offs, the select few that comes through that, basically, I guess trolling me, they troll the Q and A, they troll the comment sections of these stories as well." 
"And I think to Mark's point is it's a good idea to remove them because it really just is a platform for hate, is what I've seen, even in positive stories, it allows divisiveness, it allows people just be you just them who wouldn't normally say anything if they were in the presence of the people that they're speaking to, but they use that as an opportunity to perpetuate this message of hate and divisiveness within our community."
"And majority of the time, it's not basing in fact, it's just a feeling or emotion that they're actually getting out because of their disdain of the story or their disdain to what's being covered." 
"So I think, in addition to that, just the coverage of the incidents that happen in the community should definitely be more exhausted." 
"And like you said, speak more to the why, and why, what's going on, what's happening to give us more background with these different stories that we really just kind of get the tip of the iceberg on." 
"And then we'll get there's probably, there'll be a follow up, the story gets updated. But it doesn't always reflect everything that's going on as it relates to the story, the people who are involved."
"Again, like Josh was saying, the media is a business and they are in the business of viewership and advertisements, and I get it." 
"Unfortunately, the media is a positive and a powerful force, and I always reflect back to Pope imperii, the MLK in the Movement Movie, because it really plays into the fact of how the media helped to change the whole complexion of this country." 
"I mean, without the media, there are certain things that were happening here in Alabama that just weren't covered nationwide that people clearly weren't aware of. And really had no, maybe had no interest in."
"But the media provided a mechanism to get those stories out in a way that was basically just look at this, you can draw your own conclusion, but look at this. And I think the same should definitely be going on with the June 1st and 3rd events." 
"And not only should it die down, but it should continually. We should continually be on our government, on our police force, we should continually keep the story active until it comes to a resolution and holding them accountable in each step of the way."
"I mean, this last meeting that McMurray gave was like a recruitment. I don't know, I guess it was like a recruitment show for the City Council." 
"Even when the media sits in some of these meetings, and you hear people agree to say that they're going to do something." 
"Like Kevin Turner, he was asked to provide an after action report. He said, Yes, I would. That was back in June. He's yet to provide anything. No one said anything. Dale Strong isn't pushing him to do anything. Josh Henry was the one who asked for it. He hasn't pushed him to do anything." 
"And the end result of it is the people who were wronged, harmed and violated during those time periods feel like, well, I guess it really doesn't matter to the city, or anyone because no one is being held accountable." 
"No one's being put in a position to even be compelled to be held accountable, because it's dropped off of the news cycle, everybody's kind of going back to normal."
"The protesters are a nuisance, and no one is... And the people who actually could hold them accountable, which is our media, kind of let them just ride out without showing up and speaking to what they said they would do."
"And I mean, public opinion is huge when it comes to these different outlets like the city county commissioners, because a lot of times people don't really know what's going on in those meetings." 
"Just from the time that we've spent going back and petitioning these different boards and these different bodies of the government. Those that don't go, they have no clue. Those that don't show up, they have no clue of the things that are happening, that are going on, and they rely on of course, the news media to be that conduit to get them that information."
"And if our media is not holding them accountable, the same way that they leave a story of something that happened in the hood kind of up in the air and leave you to kind of draw your own conclusions based on the actors in the story. I mean, that's not right. I can't agree with that." 
"And I think the same way that they allow the public to kind of draw their conclusion, similarly is how they lay off of these different actors in our government and our chiefs when they don't follow through, and that's not just aol.com. I'm just talking about the news media in general, whether they're parts or say that they are, or say that they're not, just truly objective media and news outlets would hold everybody accountable equally."
"And that not only holds everyone equally but show the full story while doing so." 
"Because major changes are happening at every council meeting, and those need... The public is... Yes, we have the hsv.tv link to view that, but let's be real, these people need to be informed. Everyone needs to be informed on these votes."
