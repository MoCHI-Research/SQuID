Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,I think that one of the main concerns is that people aren't taking it as seriously as we should. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,"I think there are people that are still up and about doing unnecessary things, exposing themselves. Which creates more exposure for everybody that they come in contact with. "

Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,"So that just makes it all stressful, because you're trying to limit all the contact that people have. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,But then when people have to go out and work and have contact with all these ... like it's how do you do it?
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,"That is just kind of like a big pressure that if someone is positive, then I've been with them, so it's like ... if that makes sense."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,It's just kind of like [crosstalk] that fear every day that you don't know what's going to happen. I guess.
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,"Because even those that are affected by it with work, they still are risking themselves by going out to work."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,I was very high risk of exposure. Like even one of the places that I watered was St. Mary's Hospital or I would also do the airport.
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,"So it's like going to the hospital and getting tested, or getting checked or whatever, into the hospital, but then the next day finding out that that hospital has doctors that are testing positive and giving it to their patients is like ... like all of that is scary. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Public Health and Safety,So it makes it so it's like nothing's really safe in that career field. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"Like those who are doing better than some of us, for example I'm part of the kitchen workers. So I was basically in a very bad sad place.

"
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"So it's just seeing that now all this stuff is happening, and people who work jobs that are actually like you can't work from home, you have to be physically there to do it, whether that be a trade job or working in kitchen."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"Yeah, like actually doing something with your hands, where you can't do it from somewhere else. "

Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,And I think that working for some people right now is a necessity. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,There are some people that can't just say I'm going to stay home and be safe. It's not a luxury that they can afford at this moment. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"Because they have children, because they have rent to pay, because they have whatever to pay for. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,Because there's like a big amount of people that can't file for unemployment or won't get accepted.
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,Right. And just unemployment shouldn't be the answer because it's also a long process. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"Like my sister.

"
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,So imagine the people that are not getting helped through this(unemployment). Like it's just very unaccessible sometimes.
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,And they ask for so much information that a lot of people don't even have at hand.

Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"Like I said before, I'm part of a kitchen staff, I work as a cook. I was one of the first ones to get closed down. "

Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,I myself am able to get unemployment. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,And like someone who said before unemployment is just not an answer to the question right now how are we going to survive? 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"That's the government just giving their backs to everybody, and that's not okay."

Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"So like for families like that, that's what I'm wondering how they're going to be able to handle that especially for families that can't file for unemployment at all. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"My boss who owns the company, he's already talked to me and told me how we're most likely going to lose clients because of this. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"Because some small businesses, that when they do open up whenever they can, if their plants are dead, they're not going to be able to afford different new plants and restart up the contract. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"And so if we can't afford to insure all of these businesses with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of plants, to replace everything just because of a crisis. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"So the fact that I'm already losing clients, losing hours."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Financial Concerns and Economic Impact,"And then now like yeah, it was busy and great for me last week, because I was preparing for all these closures.

Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So having my family in another country and not being able to access them or have them come, or be able to see them, especially because my parents are older. I think that's one of the my main concerns."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"And of course, making sure that my family and my friends are taken care of. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,Because I know that this affects everyone economically. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"The economy is going to be doing really, really bad and that's, I think, one of the biggest concerns after the whole thing passes. So, yeah."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"For one of my financial concerns because living in Madison, City of Madison hasn't really given a crap about people of color, especially black people, as a social stance, because they all are fake liberal. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So it's just seeing that now all this stuff is happening, and people who work jobs that are actually like you can't work from home, you have to be physically there to do it, whether that be a trade job or working in kitchen."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Yeah, like actually doing something with your hands, where you can't do it from somewhere else. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Even though people chose that career because they enjoy that work, it's still like now what are you supposed to do?"
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Because everyone who's saying that they want to help, or all the people that are helping, not saying that they want to help. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"All the foundations and all the companies and stuff that are helping, they're small companies or community focused. It's not like a big corporation or like the government or like utility companies. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"People aren't stopping bills, they're postponing eviction, which is cute, but it's like you still got to pay that money. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"And if you haven't been making money this whole time, then how you supposed to pay back something that you couldn't afford in the first place."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So it just keeps you like 'What am I supposed to do. Should I work, is it worth risking going out to work because I need money, or should I stay home?'"
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,And I think that working for some people right now is a necessity. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,There are some people that can't just say I'm going to stay home and be safe. It's not a luxury that they can afford at this moment. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Because they have children, because they have rent to pay, because they have whatever to pay for. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So that just makes it all stressful, because you're trying to limit all the contact that people have. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,But then when people have to go out and work and have contact with all these ... like it's how do you do it?
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,Because there's like a big amount of people that can't file for unemployment or won't get accepted.
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,Right. And just unemployment shouldn't be the answer because it's also a long process. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Like my sister. She helps people with applying for unemployment and she was telling me about how the lines were saturated becausem like a bunch of people were calling at the same time, so she has to be on wait for like three hours to help just one person. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,So imagine the people that are not getting helped through this(unemployment). Like it's just very unaccessible sometimes.
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,And they ask for so much information that a lot of people don't even have at hand.
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"I mean I lost all of my income, because I am a performer and I own a salon, and I can't do either right now. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So I'm just like, I don't have really a lot of options. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,The good thing is that I guess like I had some money saved. So I'll be okay to get through the next couple of weeks. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"But at the same time, we don't know how long this is going to last. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Because they'll tell us a couple weeks, but we really don't know. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,Because new information keeps coming every day and everything keeps changing. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So at this point, we just all have to kind of look at all of your options and figure out what we're going to be able to do to keep surviving."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Like I said before, I'm part of a kitchen staff, I work as a cook. I was one of the first ones to get closed down. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"And right now you just have to figure out how to stretch your money as much as possible, and find different ways to get income. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,I myself am able to get unemployment. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,And like someone who said before unemployment is just not an answer to the question right now how are we going to survive? 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"That's the government just giving their backs to everybody, and that's not okay."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Fortunately I've had the, like I'm lucky enough to not be financially affected by it right now. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"I still able to work from home and able to get my income, but a lot of people that are in worse situations than I am. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Like my sister, she worked at Madison College, and her partner worked at a restaurant, and they have a kid and now neither of them have income coming in. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So like for families like that, that's what I'm wondering how they're going to be able to handle that especially for families that can't file for unemployment at all. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So they can't get any sort of income, and it's people that have been working two three jobs just to get by. And now, how are they going to do that?"
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"I think for me working in the medical field, it's been it's been kind of tough I guess, because we've had so many like [inaudible] there I guess. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"That is just kind of like a big pressure that if someone is positive, then I've been with them, so it's like ... if that makes sense."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,It's just kind of like [crosstalk] that fear every day that you don't know what's going to happen. I guess.
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Because even those that are affected by it with work, they still are risking themselves by going out to work."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"It affects everybody emotionally, and not just financially."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Well, I worked in horticulture, indoor horticulture, so I do a private company with a whole bunch of different businesses around Madison. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"And I started feeling this as soon as corporate America started feeling it, because my clients started calling and saying that they were closed. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,And so I've been changing my people around and working like crazy to try to water and protect all these plants for however these people are going to closed for.
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"My boss who owns the company, he's already talked to me and told me how we're most likely going to lose clients because of this. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"Because some small businesses, that when they do open up whenever they can, if their plants are dead, they're not going to be able to afford different new plants and restart up the contract. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"And so if we can't afford to insure all of these businesses with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of plants, to replace everything just because of a crisis. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So the fact that I'm already losing clients, losing hours."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"And then now like yeah, it was busy and great for me last week, because I was preparing for all these closures. But now this week all my clients are closed, so I'm like just sitting here waiting. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,And so that's one aspect of just like not really knowing the future of that.
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"And it's really sad, because that's actually a career that I enjoy, and it's one of my passions. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,So we'll just have to see how that business is affected by all of this. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"But it also was putting a risk at me, because I made contact with so many people every single day, going in and out of offices of hundreds of people each day, and going through at least four offices a day. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,I was very high risk of exposure. Like even one of the places that I watered was St. Mary's Hospital or I would also do the airport.
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,"So it's like going to the hospital and getting tested, or getting checked or whatever, into the hospital, but then the next day finding out that that hospital has doctors that are testing positive and giving it to their patients is like ... like all of that is scary. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,So it makes it so it's like nothing's really safe in that career field. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Stories and Experiences,But then my other job managing a winery. And the service industry is another place that we're getting hit really hard. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,"Just because you can only do take out, and no one really is like trying to take out like that. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,"I have some regulars that are really trying to support the business and they're trying to, like they bought a couple cases of wines, trying to support and make sure that we have some kind of income."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,"But I had to lay off, indefinitely, all of my employees, because ... none of them are full time, this is all a wine store shop. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,"So it's like now I'm telling them that there's no hours for anybody, because they can't make tips. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,So there's no reason for them to come in. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,And it's just been really hard having those conversations with other people who are trying to feed themselves and their families. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,"And students who are now like, they don't even know where they're supposed to stay, what they're supposed to do, what their actual obligations are ... the companies are to their education. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,Everything is up in the air. 
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Economic and Job-related Impact,Impact on Business and Employees,And it's just really hard because like both of those positions are affected greatly. So in return I am affected greatly.
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,I'm growing my beard out. It's great.
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,I'll try to grow my mustache out. It's coming in real nicely now. 
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"So I think that with all the things going on, I haven't really had time, which is come up with a self care routine or a self care, I don't know, something. "
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,Just because everything has been so chaotic and everything is just happening. 
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"And I'm barely trying to get accustomed to work from home and doing all the virtual meetings, and doing all of that. And finding a way for me to get organized with that. "
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"So, everything is still kind of messy. "
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"So for self care, I honestly haven't done much besides pet Mowgli and Deku and go on walks with them."
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,I went super crazy when this first started and I started cleaning everything. 
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"And then I realized, I was like I need to stop to do everything because I'm going to run out of things to do. "
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"So now I've been trying to grow past [inaudible] doing things like my brushes and stuff, like my makeup brushes I haven't cleaned them at all. "
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,Because I'm trying to leave them for last moment just so I don't run out of things to do. 
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,Because I feel like once I run out of things to do I'm just going to freak out. 
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"So, I also went to buy supplies for my [inaudible] projects and stuff. Like making wigs and making lashes. "
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"Like extra stuff that I know that will kill time, just in case I need something to do."
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"I guess I got these wipes, they're nice. They cover your face."
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,I got chickens. That was my self care. I got little chickadees. 
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,And I also started working on my garden for the summer. 
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"And I also have put a lot of time into starting something I've always wanted to do, which is urban agriculture consulting group or company. "
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Personal Care and Activities,"And so I started doing that virtually, because everything's virtual nowadays. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"Again, work at the Department of Health, and we had an exhibit in our action center called Undesigned the Red Line. And so, it talks about redlining as a racist historical practice around housing and around access to finances, and financial institutions related to housing. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"And so, we have the exhibit, we worked with a small firm called designing the WE, W-E, who curated the exhibit. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"And so we have the map of the Bronx, and we had about 100 tours that we did throughout 2018, and we had approximately 850 folks come through the exhibit."
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"So the story is that everyone who came through the exhibit had a story about housing and where they live or their neighborhoods, and how they've been impacted by policies. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"I mean the brunt of the redlining is really around black people and people of color and how the government sanctioned these races maps to push people out, and steer people to the suburbs that you all have experience with."
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"But the story is that not only did people have a story about it, but a lot of people were significantly relieved by the fact that they understood that there was a policy that was driving this. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"So when you go into communities, I work in the East [Tremont] section of the Bronx. Born and bred and buttered in Harlem, predominantly these were segregated neighborhoods that were impacted by redlining. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"And a lot of those people who came to me were just relieved by the fact that, you know what, this community looks the way it looks, and similar to what you're talking about in terms of like that feeling like where is that anger and feeling being rejected?"
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"And so a lot of people internalize the feeling like I did something wrong or my parents did something wrong, or my grandparents did something wrong. But in fact, there were policies that put this in place. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"And I enjoyed doing the tours, so I led a lot of them and we just had people who would just cry, who were just angry. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"I mean we said in our community agreement that don't expect closure, because it's not the exhibit that's going to give you closure. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,But you're free to continue to study as you like. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"But, yeah, people were significantly impacted by the fact that it was actually a policy, that it wasn't their fault. Really is the bottom line."
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,But there's all kinds of stuff that happens with subsidized housing. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,Just affordable housing in general with how gentrification is going now. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"The place that I grew up and I would never, ever, ever move back to, is now being redone and is supposed to be like one of the nicest places. It makes no sense."
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"I mean yeah everybody's experience is different, right? It depends on what situation you're in. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"So obviously it affects everybody differently, especially people that are in that situation."
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,I feel like typically it affects low income people and people of color.
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,But the worst part is that just they typically don't have a say in how these policies go. [inaudible]
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Housing Policies and Community Impact,"They just need to learn how to actually be organized and listen to the community, instead of trying to make all these decisions based on whatever they think. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,"Because what we need now is support and comfort, because obviously the situation is bad no matter what and it's probably going to get a lot worse before it gets better. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,And right now what everybody's doing is either not taking it seriously at all or freaking out. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,"So I think what they need to do is educate, try to educate everybody on the topic, but also not make it seem like we're all going to die. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,Because I feel like that (we're all going to die) is what a lot of people are thinking right now.
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,And those two groups of people are just making this situation escalate way more than it should be.
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,I feel like they need to start listening more to what the community is saying. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,"And yeah, stop this hysteria from propagating because everybody's going crazy about this topic. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,"Everybody is losing their minds and fear just gets spreading amongst us and that's just not a good way, that's not a good policy."
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,"I personally just think very similarly, of course, they have to listen to the concerns of the community and address them more properly and more accurately. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,I do understand that we're in the middle of chaos. It's really hard for them to follow proper protocols sometimes. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,"But also, like when it comes to local representatives, there's only so much that they can do. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Community and Government Response to Crisis,So I don't have a lot of faith in all that and all the things that they're going to be able to do for us. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"As for the level of comfort, I feel like every day I feel less comforted by the government, less than I was before this whole crisis. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"For me, I think that first they need to actually work with the medical system and the doctors and support the doctors how they need to be supported. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"Because I did my little interview thingy by virtual visit, because of having symptoms and possibly being exposed from going to the hospital. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,And the doctor was damn near venting to me about how she was irritated with all of this. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,She's telling me that I can't get a test because they aren't even able to get tests. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"And she's telling me unless I'm actually dying and can't breathe and if I'm old, then it doesn't matter. And asthma doesn't matter."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"And she even told me like, 'Well, even if you got a test, we don't know what to do with it.' "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"'So if you're positive or negative, you're still supposed to do the same thing, which is stay at home and drink fluids or whatever.' "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"And so it's like right now, the medical professionals don't really know what the hell's happening and they're not able to get a good source of information and support. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,It's like it just means that we're all just left out here to our own mind. And that's very dangerous. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"And I feel like they need protection, the doctors don't feel protected, they're getting it and they're spreading it to patients because they have to work. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,But they also aren't given all the masks and the gloves and whatever precautions that they need. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experience and Opinion on Medical System,"I almost quit because I was on hold on a virtual waiting room for like six hours, and I'm like this is stupid I wouldn't even wait this long in the actual waiting room. I would have been left by now."
Unclassified Information,Unclassified,Not Grouped,Not Grouped,"And that's been pretty cool to being able to try to get people to grow their own food, trying to find some other way to occupy myself and find some other way to not feel so at the will of whatever society's doing."
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,"So like this is very dumb. And also for the lady to be like, yo, I'm mad, too, I don't know what to tell you. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,So it's like literally no one knows what to do or what to say. So that's kind of upsetting. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,"Somebody needs to actually become a boss and do what needs to be done for the people, actually lead, instead of just saying that they are. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,There needs to be someone who actually does it. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,"No, it's not going to be beautiful, people are going to be mad. The rich people are going to be upset because they're not making money. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,"But no one needs to make money right now, people need to stay alive. [crosstalk] That's what the focus needs to be on."
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,"And that's the issue with just like our local representatives, they don't have so much control over that. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,"And the people that actually do, they are the rich people, they are the rich people that are not going to be wanting these things to happen. "
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Community and Government Response,Frustration and Criticism of Leadership,"So it's just stupid, it's just stupid because they will never give up the resources that they don't want to give to help other people. Because for them it's not worth it. So it's just dumb."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Medical Field and Resources,"But I feel like the medical field needs help, because they're the ones that people are looking towards getting a response and getting an answer to, so they need the support to get to that point."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Medical Field and Resources,"And the medical field is really short on equipment, so that doesn't help."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Medical Field and Resources,"That's scary. [inaudible] scariest part of all of it, but it's not even just the illness, it's the fact that if people get sick in masses, the hospitals don't have the resources. "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Medical Field and Resources,"They don't have the doctor, they don't have the staff, they don't have anything to be able to follow up with it. And I think that's the scariest part."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Medical Field and Resources,"Yeah, they already barely had enough resources when this started. and now it increased so much more."
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Medical Field and Resources,"And like the lady told me to wear a mask, because I have roommates, but how am I supposed to get a mask when the doctors can't get a mask? "
Economic Considerations,Public and Economic Impact,Public Health Concerns,Concerns about Medical Field and Resources,"Like stuff like that don't make sense. It's like all ... the medical material, they all have to go to them and there's still not enough."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experiences and Challenges,[crosstalk] like celebrities shouldn't have to donate it. Government should make sure that hospitals have the things [crosstalk 00:46:41].
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experiences and Challenges,"Yeah, like I don't even got a thermometer. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experiences and Challenges,They're telling me to check my fever. How am I supposed to get a thermometer? They're all gone. [crosstalk]
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experiences and Challenges,"We had to, at work, we have to monitor ourselves. "
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experiences and Challenges,And one of the things is to check your temperature two times a day. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experiences and Challenges,It was a struggle to find a thermometer. It took me a couple days to find one. 
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experiences and Challenges,"I want to who knows how many stores trying to find one, and that was like right after everybody went chaotic and bought all the toilet paper and thermometers."
Personal Aspects,Personal Aspects,Personal Experiences and Emotions,Personal Experiences and Challenges,Do pets have thermometers? Can we use a pet thing?
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Panic Buying and Resource Scarcity,I also noticed like these Facebook group where people are posting like Target has toilet paper and disinfecting wipes. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Panic Buying and Resource Scarcity,"And then you're posting this to 4000 people on a Facebook group. And then I'm assuming if everybody's seeing it, everybody's going to be running to get these things. [crosstalk]"
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Panic Buying and Resource Scarcity,Well the good thing is that now they started limiting what everybody can buy. 
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Panic Buying and Resource Scarcity,"I just want to shopping and only one pack of toilet paper per family, which is what should be done because [inaudible] crazy. Right?"
Community Involvement,Community and Government Actions,Resource Management and Policies,Panic Buying and Resource Scarcity,"Or maybe they do need more than one pack, because they don't know how to cook either, so they probably got the boo-boos. "
