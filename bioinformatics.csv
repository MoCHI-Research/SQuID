z,goal of the work would be to try and mitigate or try and understand the epidemiologies that we can mitigate in resistance development.  
S2,Most of the work that I do is related to antimicrobial resistance because the public health agency of Canada.  
S3,"most of my research is related to AMR particularly from farm animals, so I do a lot of on farm sampling and things like that.  "
S4,"It can vary quite a lot. On a day to day basis I work with 4-5 different people in my organization,.  "
S5,It can vary quite a lot. when I'm working on these multi collaborative groups like I'm doing with Colorado State and Dr. Morley and Noelle and things like that boy it can be like 10 or 20 up to 20 people that are involved depending on the project. 
S6,"Often I am involved with… that's a tough one how to define a role… so quite often it's in the planning and development of the project. So that would be one aspect of it, so coming together and actually coming up with the idea and planning it, getting funding and then once you get the funding you can execute it.  "
S7,And then once the project’s in place and it's rolling then often then our next role comes in with the analyzing and summarizing the data so that it can be published.  
S8,Sometimes I am the PI where I am actually the one that is writing the grant and providing and doing all the main work and the funding and then I’m calling on other people to help fill in the gaps where my expertise isn't.  
S9,in other cases I am like a co-applicant or a supporting person and I am trying to help fill in some gaps where the PI might be lacking.  
S10,so maybe their specialty is more in survey design or something but they want to something in AMR and needs me for the AMR aspect of it.  
S11,"Quite often it's working with students and getting the students to do the analysis, and so there's helping and supporting them in developing their education and understanding of how to approach these types of data.  "
S12,there would probably be at least 20 (collaborators on my current research project.  
S13,I have two sort of roles in this project. Part of my role in that particular one is that they were looking they’re using a lot of isolettes or samples from a previous project that I was a PI on and their samples and isolettes from Canada so they were wanting to test those using their metagenomics techniques and so I'm incorporated into the project just from that aspect of it because they'll be utilizing some of the samples and isolettes that we have from the previous project.  
S14,my goal is there to sort of help facilitate the inclusion of those isolettes and then any sort of support that we can give to providing some sort of context those isolettes would also be of value.  
S15,They have an advisory group as well that sort of meets occasionally to discuss the fast forward working throughout and things along those lines and so I'm also part of that advisory group.  
S16,I would say almost 100% of my projects involve at least one collaborator from another institution.  
S17,Canada and the government they really try to encourage us as much as possible to work with researchers both within and outside of Canada internationally and develop those networks and connections because they feel that that's important to make the most of the resources that we have there's limited resources.  
S18,we're all sort of working towards the same end game often so if you can get together with likeminded people then you can have a much better benefit.  
S19,How do you choose the collaborators at the other institutions who you want to work with? Often it's through meeting them through other collaborators that I've already worked with and then I get introduced to them.  
S20,like Dr. Belk in your situation at Colorado state I didn't know Dr. Belk before but I knew Dr. Morley and Dr
S21,quite often it's from previous people working with these individuals in previous projects or that they know of them and so that's sort of how we end up getting new collaborators developed.  
S22,developed you kind of get a network that gets going and you meet people who are working in the same area as you through that network and provides opportunities for you to work with them.  
S24,I have some collaborations with some people out at the university of Calgary and at the vet college there and I'm one project with them and their role is relatively minor so they're more the supportive person providing some expertise they'd be giving some input on papers etc.  
S25,I'm with them on another project and they're the PI so it can really change dramatically from particular project to particular project.  
S26,"So in your first example you're relying on these researchers provide specific expertise that you can't get somewhere else?  Yes, that would be correct.  "
S27,I've been very very fortunate with the groups of people that I've managed to collaborate with for the most part I've always felt that it was a very inclusive sort of environment people were very aware of the sensitivity.  
S28,what can end up happening is that people have similar sorts of interests they may want to have a piece of that project as their own and somebody might also want a piece of that project for them to work on and things.  
S29,sometimes you have to be aware of the fact that the sharing of the data and the sharing of the information so that everyone gets and equal opportunity to uhm have the piece of the project that’s theirs and that is relevant to them and works for them and for those pieces that overlap each other to make sure that you're as inclusive as possible.  
S30,I'm tending to work with some of the sample people again and again it's because I've found that they're a good fit and that we work well together and we really respect each other's thoughts and opinions and each other's sort of areas.  
S31,I've been doing this long enough now that I kind of know who I want to work with and who I like to work with and who works well.  
S32,when you're working with other collaborators so you know quite often you end up working with people that you know you can kind of deal with and work with and then when they introduce you to new people to work with quite often those people are also of similar mind and then so that helps facilitate those ongoing relationships.  
S33,I think that you can get bigger projects so that you can get larger sums of money.  
S34,(large project benefit) and you can also potentially have a project that spans a broader scope because you may have somebody that's in the micro end and then somebody that  is doing epidemiology and somebody else that's doing sociology or economics or whatever the case may be.  
S35,(large project benefit) I get a lot of different people with different ideas that come together and they might help you see it from a different perspective and give you some new insight into it.  
S36,(large project benefit) it also helps round out the entire project and approach so it makes it hopefully more meaningful as an entire package than if each one of us was doing our own little area on our own.  
S37,I think there's lots of opportunity to cross over with people that have different backgrounds and expertize I regularly work with the computer programmer and stuff like that.  
S38,What are the disadvantages or problems associated with working on projects with collaborators in different fields?Language is sometimes a challenge when I use for terminology the same terms may be used differently within their sphere.  
S39,if I say something's significant or that there's a significant difference I mean that statistically there's a significant difference where somebody else might say there's a significant difference without applying any statistics to it and so that sort of language may be different.  
S40,(benefits to heterogeneous groups) Just because it allows you some more insight into other realms and gives you some ideas for potentially expanding your knowledge base and making use of other people's expertise and trying to find a solution to whatever it is that you happen to be researching.  
S41,sometimes if we're all sort of coming from the same place maybe the biggest disadvantage is that we don't necessarily think of it outside of our area of expertise so we're not really understanding it maybe from the whole big picture part of things we're just looking at one piece of it.  
S42,(benefit to homo group) sometimes you're just looking at once pieces of it and sometimes that's all you need to look at to try and get your answer so you're just looking really specifically at something from that specific point of view.  
S43,You always have data sharing agreements that you have to have in place and so that's always a standard sort of thing that needs to be performed so you need to have an understanding and how you're going to share the data and who's going to use it when where and how.  
S44,I am always on the analysis and sort of looking at the data from an analytical point of view and how to analyze it and what we need to do with it as far as presenting it.  
S45,I am always on the analysis and sort of looking at the data from an analytical point of view and how to analyze it and what we need to do with it as far as presenting it.  
S46,usually my role is in design as well as a part of being an epidemiologist.  
S47,(data sharing) Quite often it's dictated to us somewhat by the organization that we work with so often the legal department at the universities will have some sort of data sharing agreements that they'll have in place and then they share them with us at the public health agency and then we come to an agreement on how we're what the exact wording is going to be for the data sharing.  
S48,at the end of the day there's a formal written document that stipulates that you know these are the data that we're going to share and this is likely how they're going to be used etc. etc.  
S49,(data sharing) you have the in person or the teleconference discussions about the nitty gritty parts of it so breaking it down into much more detail as to who's going to do what and when those things are going to happen.  
S50,the departments within the government that deal with intellectual property and there just has to be agreements between the two legal departments between the two organizations to make sure that it's clear what everybody is agreeing to do and that they have the authority to do that.  
S51,quite often those agreements are sort of a 10 thousand foot view and then the actual working part of it you know the I'm going to write a paper on this or I'm going to analyze the data from this or I'm going to make sure that the isolettes are tested for you know these with these tests that tis much more specific and is usually just from the informal group discussion.  
S52,I would say that almost 100% of my collaborations well there's usually some component to both teleconferencing and meeting in person).  
S53,more often than not most of the conversations are done through teleconference because we're usually quite dispersed so there might be people you know out in eastern Canada there might be people down in the states like Colorado or in Alberta or Calgary so there's people from all over the place that will make it very difficult for you to have routine in person meetings so usually stuff is done via teleconference or WebEx’s or skype or something along those lines.  
S54,we often will try once a year or so to get into a face to face type meeting but it just depends upon the budget and what's available and also on the project so that's the challenge is that quite often these things have to be done by distance.  
S55,I think that the disadvantage is to teleconferencing is that it you're not as engaged I think often on the phone as you are in person you're not as focused you might be multitasking and distracted and so if it's something that's not specific to you at that point in time you're more likely to be sort of drawn away or distracted by you know something else that's going on.  
S56,and it's also difficult sometimes when to you're on teleconference particularly get a read for the people in the room as to sort of what the atmosphere is or how they're feeling or what they're sort of thought process are.  
S57,whereas if you're in the room you can read body language and facial expressions and those sorts of things.  
S58,teleconferencing as well to try and just get a good feel for where people are coming from and so those dynamics those sort of interpersonal dynamics are missing.  
S59,quite often if you're meeting with people in person you get the opportunity you know to have one on one conversations with people without the entire hearing what you're saying and you can't really do that very easily over a teleconference.  
S60,quite often if you're meeting with people in person you get the opportunity you know to have one on one conversations with people without the entire hearing what you're saying and you can't really do that very easily over a teleconference you have to kind of table it and have a separate conversation with them at a separate time which may not I don't know sometimes that can be challenging.  
S61,quite often it's just telephone teleconferencing and discussions and things if we feel that there's a need for having some sort of interface where we can you know see presentations or working documents anything along those lines so I've used adobe … one project I've used the blue jeans from Colorado state I've used the WebEx version I've … those are probably going to be the main ones that I’ve used.  
S62,I find that the thing with skype that frustrates me about skype is that quite often the voice part of it isn't very good it kind of cuts in and out and is maybe a little slow with the video feed and things so I'm just not a big Skyper.  
S63,.  
S64,telephone I think that it's always consistent and it always works right so I can be guaranteed that regardless of what happens my telephone will work.  
S65,work I can't always guarantee that WebEx is going to work and that we're not going to have linking issues or that you're not going to have issues with skype or even blue jeans or whatever like some of those more complex technologies they can go wrong and especially if you start to get a lot of people on them.  
S66,"webex, skype etc I've had challenges with you know people not being able to hear you when you're talking you know just microphone issues compatibility with your computer issues all that sort of stuff that's a challenge.  "
S67,I use the telephone with all of my collaborators but I also like I say just depending upon the meeting and stuff we will do internet connection as well but definitely but I have used the telephone with all of my collaborators in the past.  
S68,And when you're doing these meetings where you're doing a web connection is that kind of like an everybody's there kind of meeting or just with a couple? Yes that's often the way it is that it's an everybody's there meeting and.  
S69,sometimes it's just a one on one and we need to really I need to be able to see some data that they're working on or some information that they're working on and that we need to be able to discuss it as we look at the information together and so even sometimes it will be only one or two people out of the group that are having these discussions and they're be actually doing an internet connection of some fashion so that we can actually look at the same thing at the same time and make sure that we're all understanding each other.  
S70,do you ever choose to use one over another for a specific collaborator? sometimes it's a matter of what they can access and what works for them.  
S71,I tend to use WebEx more than anything and that's just because that's what we use within the government and so that tends to be my go-to thing.  
S72,quite often if I'm dealing with other people you know from other organizations or whatever they have their own either internal university one that they use or they have their own personal one that they like to use so it can vary with the collaborators.  
S73,blue jeans was a more specific to Colorado state than it is to some of the others and then there's another program that we used out of Kansas state for a different project that was only you're only able to access it was actually through Kansas state so there was like university specific programs that you had to be invited and included in by their invitation in order to be able to even access it.  
S74,there'll be aspects of it that you'll be responsible for summarizing and presenting to the rest of the group and you kind of like I say previously have your arrangement or agreement as to who's going to do what and then you'll go from there.  
S75,So when you're presenting can you what kind of tools are you using or how is this presentation sort of conversation going?Sometimes it can be via PowerPoint that you'll do your presentation in and you'll just do a summary sort of formal type presentation.  
S76,you may have shared a document or output or something like that from your programming or you're even your syntax or whatever you might share that or have some discussion about those things and then go through those documents even just as you're going over the phone you can say well if you look under section 2 you can see that I put x y or z and I'd like your input on this or this is how I've interpreted this or whatever the case.  
S77,other times like I say if you're actually connecting over and above just being on the telephone and you have an actual interface between the two of you. You can show those documents on the interface or you can do a formal like PowerPoint presentation as well.  
S79,Usually it's a larger group that we do PowerPoints for.  
S80,unless we're preparing for a different meeting with some external stakeholders or something like that and then maybe we'll go through the PowerPoints together and have a discussion about how we want to present things or what’s going to be included or not going to be included in a particular PowerPoint.  
S81,more often than not within the group if you're doing a PowerPoint presentation it's usually for the group as a whole not just one or two people.  
S82,"And just out of quick curiosity, why PowerPoint? What other presentation tool are you thinking? Well I mean I've seen people use a pdf or… Oh yeah I've done that too.  "
S83,PowerPoint I think I go to just because it's what I know uhm and it's what I have on my computer and so it's easy to use.  
S84,I've gone to some conferences and things like that if people are going between versions of PowerPoint then they've had issues with formatting but me personally I've never run into that.  
S85,So when you're sharing documents or program output what kind of tool are you using how you are sharing that? Sometimes it's just a word document sometimes it's I'll pdf it and send it as a pdf those would probably be the most common and excel files sometimes.  
S86,So when you're sharing documents or program output what kind of tool are you using how you are sharing that?Sometimes it's just a word document sometimes it's I'll pdf it and send it as a pdf those would probably be the most common and excel files sometimes.  
S87,So when you're sharing documents or program output what kind of tool are you using how you are sharing that?Sometimes it's just a word document sometimes it's I'll pdf it and send it as a pdf those would probably be the most common and excel files sometimes.  
S88,So are you sending them documents with email?Yeah usually.  
S89,I have Dropbox and I don't use it routinely unless it's for big files and things like that but I have used it.  
S90,if the files are getting really big there's often limits on your email as to how big of a file you can send so it depends on the size of the file.  
S91,when would you use email over dropbox the people that I’m working with some of them are not Dropbox users and aren't comfortable you know taking an approach that way.  
S92,email is primarily the challenge is that the file sizes get to big and so you have to split stuff up and send it in separate emails and things so that's the challenge right.  
S93,emailing documents sometimes it's for the entire group and sometimes it's just for a sub group of us that are working on a particular aspect of the project.  
S94,I guess that the challenge is with a larger group is that sometimes there's different settings on firewalls and things like that size of files that can be sent and so on so that you get bounce backs and then it gets to be more difficult but that would be the biggest issue I think sharing documents.  
S95,then when you're discussing these files that you're sharing what tool do you typically use for that?we're usually on the phone or like I say sometimes we'll use the uhm some sort of internet connection so that we can actually both see they can see my screen or I can see their screen we can share you know a viewing privileges back and forth or presenter privileges.  
S96,sometimes it's just an email back and forth or you'll read the document and review it and add comments or questions or thoughts or whatever or sometimes you'll do it that way as well discussing shared files.  
S97,if we're trying to make some decisions about where we want to go and how we want to do things quite often with will be more like a telephone call or web communication if there's something that sort of needs to be discussed and worked out … and it's sort of a major concept idea.  
S98,whereas the email you might actually have something that you've already come to terms with how you're going to deal with it and it's just sort of getting written up.  
S99,you might be adding in feedback on the information that's been provided how it's been presented you might just spend time doing that on your own and then writing comments throughout the document and sending emails back and forth.  
S100,or if there's something that's really quick and easy to answer you might just do that through email rather than you know doing it through a telephone call or WebEx or things.  
S101,so sometimes it's a quick and easy thing you'll do it through email.  
S102,sometimes if it's like a manuscript that you want to go through and provide details edits and comments on then you'll do that also through email because you'll want to spend the time actually really focusing on the document yourself.  
S103,I think is that particularly with email there's no context it's like saying text messages people can read tone or attitude into the written word if you're not careful about how you phrase it or how you respond and sometimes even as simple as a yes or a no can be taken out of context so you take the risk of potentially offending somebody or upsetting them.  
S104,if you're actually having a conversation with them they can hear the tone and they can hear the input.  
S105,there's an opportunity for a back and forth discussion actually having a conversation with them phone.  
S106,"If you could create a hypothetical future technology to make collaborating easier, what would it be?Something that's universal.  "
S107,"If you could create a hypothetical future technology to make collaborating easier, what would it be?that is technically simple.  "
S108,"If you could create a hypothetical future technology to make collaborating easier, what would it be?reliable.  "
S109,"If you could create a hypothetical future technology to make collaborating easier, what would it be?inexpensive.  "
S110,"If you could create a hypothetical future technology to make collaborating easier, what would it be?If it has opportunity for good interaction I guess like engaging and interacting.  "
S111,"you probably encountered one of the difficulties of where I am, we have where I am. a lot of the people we want to talk to are in a different hemisphere and a different time zone.  "
S112,ok and what is the goal of your research? it’s usually eventual cure of the infections.  
S113,It’s a mixture between applied and basic research.  
S114,"Ok, so what is the average number of researchers or collaborators on projects that you worked on in general? Maybe 5, can I qualify that so if it would you count principle investigators only or the teams of those investigators as well The teams as well Ok then that would be more like 15 to 20.  "
S115,Ok the largest groups that I’m involved in at the moment just thinking it’s got 10 principle investigators. And it would represent over 100 participants if we counted the teams and students.  
S116,The smallest would be 2 principles with a team of 5 personnel.  
S117,"if they are local and I would say that is within melbourne, a lot of the different participants will have different professional duties. So I’m a research and teaching appointment at the university while I’ll be working with someone who is an infectious diseases person with a case load and trying to schedule opportunities to get researchers together is really difficult. Um, because of the competing demands on peoples time. Very few of us are research only"
S118,If it’s a national collaboration then the distances in Australia are really huge. So the nearest expert could be 1000 kilometers away. So the opportunities to interact with them directly are even less. 
S119,If it’s a national collaboration then the distances in Australia are really huge. So the nearest expert could be 1000 kilometers away. So the opportunities to interact with them directly are even less. And so people try to make good use of conferences and things to piggy back meetings onto
S120,large projects because I think that the real thing that has made the greatest benefits is that you are exposed to very different ways of thinking people bring quite unique perspectives to a project and as soon as somebody goes ahead we can use what you’re doing and expand it to our mutual benefit then you get this sort of opportunistic snowball effect of what was the core idea then expanding into a much larger program and that can be done when you start with a common point of interest.  
S121,small groups one of the advantages I feel is that you end up being able to get down to fine detail of experimental design and direction and the sort of strategic positioning that you can't just do in a larger forum because it’s not time efficient and so some of those meetings of 2 or 3 people where you can actually fine tune things and do the sort of polishing I guess.  
S122,small groups A disadvantage is that sometimes the amount of effort that you need for securing the ongoing funding for small project is huge so the insecurity of being able to maintain the activities is not a fit for the rewards.  
S123,in our national competitive founding the chances that a grant is granted is well under 20% and so there’s a lot an effort in putting proposals forward that don't actually lead to any actual research. Uh the big collaborative ones tend to be more successful.  
S124,people are moving more to the big collaborative groups rather than the smaller direction basically because that we've been told to go in and that’s where the successes are so we are driven to the larger groups.  
S125,"there’s two elements one is if you are a big collaborative group going for big purchase that’s more likely to be successful, as far as getting research support and then once you’ve got that support its more likely to give research outcomes as measured by further grants, publications, PhD completions and strengthen the research community is an outcome. Not easily measurable but collaborative gain.  "
S126,What my expectations be in a collaboration is that initially people would have contributed to the design of the proposed project and the arguments supporting it and working out some sort of a budget.  
S127,Once we have secured proposed funding then would have particular components that would fall into our portfolio and that we would meet regularly to report progress on those but within your own portfolio we would work in laboratory with students to designing experiments and carrying out those experiments and essentially reporting those results back to the collaborative group.  
S128,it’s my expertise as a micro biologist and I’m thinking of this big consortium in this moment. I’m in a faculty of agriculture and veterinary science. And they needed an agriculture and veterinary element to the larger project so its disciplines specific expertise and my own network and contacts is what I contribute. 
S129,"Ok, so how many collaborators are on the project? There’s 10 investigators.  "
S130,Ok so what percentage have involved at least one collaborator that is at a different institution All of them.  
S131,"Ok, and in those projects where you have collaborators at another institution why are you choosing to work with those collaborators Usually they have resources ore expertise that aren't available at my institution.  "
S132,"Ok, so how do you go about finding or choosing those collaborators? I usually use personal networks.  "
S133,I usually go to somebody and say look I need some more bioinformatics and I know you are doing a project with good bioinformatics in it how do you get that done and who do I go to talk to and I usually follow that sort of root to go and find key people locally or so yes very dependent on personal networks.  
S134,Has there ever been a situation where you didn't know anybody who had the expertise that you needed Yes and that usually resulted in us not doing the project.  
S135,we can't just say to somebody don't worry we'll find somebody because they didn't exist that would be a key component that didn't that wouldn't be achieved.  
S136,Face to face meetings are a much better form of communication and then using a skype or conference calls or while they augment those meetings. You get a lot better progress face to face.  
S137,I think it’s necessary to at least have some opportunities for those face to face.  
S138,The frequency is of course do to circumstances the personal interactions are preferable but not always achievable for international collaborators we would generally contact them through conferencing so we are going for multiple purposes on a trip.  
S139,"I use email, do conference calls to meet at a distance.  "
S140,"I’m not finding skype to be all that great, lots of unreliable. Connection is in and out, poor quality of sound and image. To the point where we oft plan a skyped meeting and replace it with phone. It’s just not good enough it’s a barrier to c communication"
S141,". It shouldn't be difficult to use skype, our faculty are distributed across a number of locations in house video conferencing that we can use works reasonably well but the people at the distance sites tend to be present in small numbers and it’s been physically at the table you get a better voice in conversations.  "
S142,When I use email is we use email as the first preference. A lot of the reporting and communication.  
S143,when an issue is complication needs the input of several people at the same time and same conversation or is sensitive then it’s better to have a conference call where people can speak in real time vs email.  
S144,Written word does not always elaborate what the person is trying to say.  
S145,"email sometimes people are reluctant to fully express themselves in writing, they are more maybe more comfortable to say it personally. Because emails can always sent on. You don't know that that conversation is stopping at that recipient. "
S146,certainly with data and so things that needed to be expressed scientifically I definitely use email to distribute documents.  
S147,I definitely use email to distribute documents or something like a drop box but probably back it up with email to say when precision is required and with a record of that needs to be embedded in the communication is email is good.  
S149,video conferencing So we have it within the faculty and it has been used within the university.  
S150,video conferencing I haven't used it between institutions because usually the system is not compatible.  
S151,I prefer to use a video conference to a telephone conference because the document connection and better interactions.  
S152,What percentage of your projects involve collaborators who are in very different fields from yours like research fieldsProbably I would say 10 to 15%.  
S153,"I have a collaboration on a historical project that is far away from my research discipline as I can think of. But there is a common theme of the history of agricultures, there’s the link there. But the historic element is quiet out of my area of expertise. Quite like it actually"
S154,I like what I find is that in your own specialized field everyone has been trained to in a certain paradigm of the way we collect design report data try it in a particular style that is impose by how a journal is written. It’s completely out of your area I’d be science engineering technology math. And go into social sciences and the approach to research is completely different and it makes me think about well better or different ways of doing things. 
S155,Are there any other benefits to working with on projects with collaborators who are in different fields?Well it does challenge your own assumptions about how research is conducted.  
S156,I was working with say engineers while it’s a different field it’s still in the science engineering medicine area so the challenge there would not be some much approached though the science but the understanding of the capacity what we can do in the mechanics of the discipline.  
S157,You can't erase that what we do relies on experts in the field.  
S158,. their expertise is what you trust and that comes again to that personal connection that you want to establish and spend that time and investment wanting to understanding what I want to get out of a project and where they see you might be contributing to their overall game.  
S159,But you know I can't always embrace the technology but yeah we to communicate that but that’s part of our job.  
S160,benefit to homo partly because you know what you know and you can actually jump over a whole lot of assumption and focus  straight on the higher level objectives and goals and you can get into that at higher level of details and that’s sometimes what you do in that small specialist groups.  
S161,benefit to homo The objective is more clearly defined rather than exploring do they understand what I’m saying and I don't understand what their saying.  
S162,Sometimes in a small group if a person is no longer available or no longer available for whatever reason. They are no longer willing or available or able to participate then you can lose a major player in a project and that could just jeopardize the whole project.  
S164,. Say I’ve got a big group here a member of that group has a significant relationship with another big group. that could be in the us or on the other side of Australia and they already have that key relationship that’s working and we would definitely be using those to bridge between groups and we would be using those small representatives from each of the large groups to make a bridge and so that we would pick out and identify things that at are of mutual benefit. 
S165,the way you found my name because of the Paul Mory proposal that actually a pretty good example of how our group on antibiotic stewardship threw some key contacts on Paul Mory proposal and ended up putting in contact with each other and then were able to start that interaction and then intern one of our members was able to say to Paul mory group we have key contacts in Asia if they would be useful to your consortium.  
S166,So it’s kind of like nodes connecting nodes is actually very valuable and you don't have to have all of the nodes participating as a large input. I think the preciseness of the nodes is I think variable but the strengths of the group backs them up.  
S167,within our faculty we have shared computer drives for groups so within the faculty secured drives are backed up by the university.  
S168,Within groups drop box is good for sharing data.  
S169,I know a lot of people use google docs but I have never really go around to using that effectively because its linked to a Gmail account.  
S170,some other emails are central repositories is certainly a norm and so it’s really essential. Otherwise you’re searching through archives for sharing data.  
S171,If the activity is within the faculty for a small group. would use the shared drive to share documents.  
S172,if it was an activity that extended beyond my faculty then I use drop box and simply because the shared drive is managed a faculty level and you can let other people into it for data security.  
S173,I know people use iPad as well but not everyone is using I technology.  
S174,Drop box is easy.  
S175,I haven't found any issues with drop box.  
S176,with the shared drive I have had issues because it may have internal it management systems change things than your upgrade something or there are changes within the it environment and the data is always there its always backed up so that reassuring but it may not always be at your finger tips.  
S177,with the shared drive I have had issues because it may have internal it management systems change things than your upgrade something or there are changes within the it environment and the data is always there its always backed up so that reassuring but it may not always be at your finger tips.  
S178,"Ok, you mentioned that sometimes when you share documents you would share it via documents and then send an email out. I know that’s redundant but it reflects my age and when you do a drop box it says your linked into it the drop box has been updated. So it doesn't tell you it’s been updated so if you are using it for multiple activates you have to go into drop box and see what was updated. "
S179,Whereas I send an email to a friend or collaborator just saying ill upload that into drop box then you can expect to see it there. That’s how I do it.  
S180,. I was involved in a multi faculty project earlier this year with probably 10 people representing a whole lot of different faculty and we used drop box.  
S181,we would have a physical meeting and have actions that were decide then and what we would say is I would prepare that apart of the document and I’ll upload it into the drop box and the next person who was dependent on that would take it and further developed the document.  
S182,we were developing a report and while there were some emails that said yes I’ve done the job it’s still the agreement on how this is what we are going to do this task. The consensus.  
S183,I think that this group worked cooperatively they need to uh have some team building time and that was done around the board table.  
S184,they could argue backwards and forwards and that was easy to do by drop an email.  
S185,The consensus needs to be reached in person.  
S186,have a brief conference call just to make sure that everybody is all on board do all understand shier roles and expectations.  
S187,reaching consensus via email I probably would have resorted to a conference call after the various individual emails and when we are close to some sort of plan then we would have a brief conference call.  
S188,I would probably uh always endeavor a conversation be it via conference call or face to face if I’m seeking commitment from other parties.  
S189,why conference call or face to face  Because you can involve multiple people at the same time.  
S190,email is just a two way conversation where as a telephone call or a face to face everybody is participating even if it is listening to the exchange and have the opportunity to contribute or dispute.  
S191,email is just a two way conversation where as a telephone call or a face to face everybody is participating even if it is listening to the exchange and have the opportunity to contribute or dispute.  
S192,The limitations with email is that it only goes between two people. I know you can copy it to everybody. And you can always over lane and unsynchronized parts of conversations. But it’s two blocky
S193,I find email has a limitation. I’d rather have voice.  
S194,If skype worked more reliably I’d do it with skype.  
S195,hypothetical well it would have some nice voice recognition software embedded into it. I have dragon for writing documents and sometimes in uh exchanges it would be handy to have those automatic minutes almost written up. I’ve had some good voice recognition. 
S196,hypothetical even if it had a voice connection the humans are interacting by vocally and audio that the computer is taking notes for us. I’d like that because it would be more efficient in recording outcomes up.  
S197,hypothetical they'd have to be some way of controlling it so that it wasn't intrusive so if so that people can't demand your attention or participation. You know on your computer you might get this little Bing Bing Bing. It’s a constant distraction from what you’re doing intrusive. You should be able to control your opt in and opt out
S198,there’s a scene in the kings men where they need to have a meeting of a number of people the boardroom table. There are two flesh and blood people at the table but the rest of the people are all holograms. That would be really cool. 
S199,there probably is really good video conferencing that are available that I just don't have access to so bit more accessible.  
S200,conferencing would make sense to me site book facilities. That would be better if you could just do it the office.  
S201,"All of my research is about meat safety management. So, did some, like, validation studies in lab or in the plant, in beef packing plant.  "
S202,"recently, my project is about using metagenomics with next-generation sequencing for pathogenic detection.  "
S203,"So, like the total number involved in the big one, I guess it's more than ten, probably fifteen-ish # of collaborators.  "
S204,We try to help industry and also provide safety products for the public.  
S205,"Smallest one, it's just like two people.  "
S206,"Just, there are a lot of projects are involved with teamwork, so I would say, ten? average #.  "
S207,small I would guess have to do more work by limited number of people.  
S208,"small Yeah, it's very, it's easier to manage the project.  "
S209,"if you only have two people, it's easy to arrange, schedule things, and we need to do it, we can do it now, but if we have more people, then you need to ask everyone's schedule.  "
S210,"if there are more people get involved, then I guess, people share less responsibilities sometimes.  "
S211,"For the projects, to be honest, sometimes few, like if we need to write manuscript, then there is a problem on the authorship thing. I guess, that's an issue.  "
S212,"large Sometimes, like the work itself requires a lot of people to get involved, cause it's just larger amount of work that need to be done, so basically two or three people just cannot finish it. So we need a teamwork.  "
S213,fifty percent of projects involve at least one collab at another institution.  
S214,"why did you choose to work with those collaborators who are not located here?Cause, they are like technical support, so we need their lab space and there lab technicians. And I think that's the most important thing.  "
S215,"So are they providing, like, some sort of service you can't get here?Yes.  "
S216,"distributed , cause if they are, a lot of people get involved in one project and, if there are some communication issues, and then you would just cannot finish your goal, cause we'll have that problem before.  "
S217,"most of the time we communicate with the labs, what they need to do, we tell them. But, in that time, also the plant told them something that what they wanted to do? And the lab just get confused. And then, we just didn't get our results back. We had to redo it"
S218,"sometimes we need to travel outside the state, so and all of those labs are very close to where we need to work on the project. So I guess, convenience? Not here, but where we actually have the project. distributed. "
S219,colocated don't think there are any disadvantages about that.  
S220,"colocated Easy to communicate, cause we don't need to really, like, write email or call; it's just like talk to people and what you need to do.  "
S221,"If you speak face-to-face, like sometimes people will know your mood, I guess? And they will know like how serious you want them to do something.  "
S222,"But if you just do email, I guess maybe sometimes people just ignore the emails.  "
S223,I really didn't do a lot of phone calls.  
S224,"cause if we work with someone that out of state, may have time difference, and we don't know what's their schedules, so it's better to give them email, rather than call them and interrupt what they are doing.  "
S225,primarily using the email.  
S226,"there is another reason we use email, cause if you call them, there is like no evidence that you called them, like everything you talk about is just a phone call and no-one record it. But if you email them then we will have some record. So, like if something get wrong after that, then you will see, hey, here is a email, I've already emailed you, that way least's there everything here, and if you make some mistake, that's your fault. So that's why we choose using email"
S227,"I really don't think we use any Skype. I only saw that one time on some other people's dissertation, but I really didn't use it.  "
S228,"about what percentage of your project, projects, involve collaborators who are in a different field than yours?My current one.  I would say, twenty?"
S229,"everyone has different background, so something, for me, maybe it's just basic thing, but for someone else, they may just not understand it.  "
S230,every time we talk about something we need to provide the background for everyone.  
S231,"that's same issue for me too, cause, like, we have collaborators with computer scientists, and they know a lot of coding stuff, but we do not have them, so when they talk about something, they think it's really simple, but just have no idea or what they are talking about.  "
S232,"have people from different research fields, will have a lot of ideas. Which will really, like, broader your way of thinking.  "
S233,"homo everyone basically's on the same page, so it's easier to have something done, maybe.  "
S234,"homo disadvantages I think should be fine. Yeah, you know, fine.  "
S235,"homo Like everyone basically's on the same page, so it's easier to have something done, maybe.  "
S236,Every week we have meeting.  
S237,"like writing a manuscript, productive, like there are just more things we can talk about, cause everyone can provide their ideas, and, if you just have your own group, you probably will not have that many good ideas.  "
S238,"what do you think has the biggest impact on the outcome? The size, the location of the people who are on the group, or their background?I think their backgrounds.  "
S239,"for data analysis, we do have server.  "
S240,"So we have both bioinformatics part and the statistics part. So we need, first of all, we need to ask help from professors, in those departments.  "
S241,"How do you choose who to contact?Cause we took their class, so we know them. And also, like from computer science, that professor just get involved in all of our projects.  "
S242,"we do have a lot of statistic analysis, and their department offer, like, consultants, so we can just, like, email them and make appointment. If we know someone, we'll just say, can we make appointment with Dr. X; if not, if they are not available, then we will say just, random. Go find someone"
S243,"Face-to-face more. Cause, basically, it's like, like one hour meeting.  "
S244,"something, like people can easy understand through visual, I will just give them printout copies. Something I really need to talk about, I will just use presentation.  "
S245,"Ok. So, do you ever share raw data with your collaborators?Yes. On the server. Cause our raw data's really huge"
S246,"data over the server, using the server, putting on the server to share?I guess sometimes we just forget to give permission to them, so they just cannot open it, I guess that's the only one.  "
S247,"And then they will just email me and then I'll just give them permission, that's it.  "
S248,. I use Dropbox too.  
S249,"Dropbox is more like, that's the results part, not the raw data, cause the raw data's really huge. But for, like, results, results from the analysis, we use Dropbox to share with them.  "
S250,"we do have some members, they do not have access to the server. So, we just have a Dropbox so we can share that with everyone in our group.  "
S251,"Ok. Have you ever had any issues with using Dropbox, and collaborating?No.  "
S252,"do you use Dropbox with all of the people that you're collaborating with, or just with some?I guess, some, that has something to do with a specific project.  "
S254,"the ones that have access to the server are the ones will do the analysis. So there are a bunch of other people that really do not do any analysis, like those professors. So, then we just share them this data. "
S255,"So if there are a bunch of data we need to share with them, we will just use Dropbox. If I have, like, very specific one or two results I want to share with them, I will just email them.  "
S256,"So if there are a bunch of data we need to share with them, we will just use Dropbox. If I have, like, very specific one or two results I want to share with them, I will just email them.  "
S257,"advantage of email for sharing data Fast, and that will really draw their attention.  "
S258,"if you do Dropbox, everyone doesn't see it. If they don't want look in it, then they will just not, they will ignore it.  "
S259,"if you send them email, they will know that's something you want them to look at right now.  "
S260,"Has using email to send data ever, like, had any issues?mmm no.  "
S261,"Basically, we write the paper and then send to everyone in that group and waiting for the response.  "
S262,"Sometimes, like everyone has their own part, but for some projects, just one person writes the initial draft.  "
S263,Ok. So what are you using to write the paper in?Word.  
S264,"Word? Okay, why Word. That's the one I have on my computer.  "
S265,"there will be one person that is in charge of that project, but just some other people to write their own part. So that one person needs to write the draft and then everyone just send their piece to that person and that person will add everything to that.  "
S266,difficulties with having each person write their own portion and submit to one person I guess everyone just needs to finish that on time.  
S267,"So, cause everyone will send their response at different times, so maybe you just correct something from this person, and then you get another person's response based on your original one, so you need to look up everything from the beginning.  "
S268,"And also, like sometimes, they may have the same edition on the same place, and now you just, don't know which one you should use.  "
S269,"So is it sent out to, like, everyone at once, or.  Yeah"
S270,"everyone will send their response at different times, so maybe you just correct something from this person, and then you get another person's response based on your original one, so you need to look up everything from the beginning email for paper writing.  "
S271,"sometimes, they may have the same edition on the same place, and now you just, don't know which one you should use email for paper writing.  "
S272,talking is fastest way to get the answer other than anything else.  
S273,"hypothetical people can record both their voice and their faces, I guess, images.  "
S274,"hypothetical if something really, really important, we use another people emails, like there are some alarms that will just, draw people's attention on those things.  "
S275,"in the very beginning, when we started to do those projects, none of us has really any background about bioinformatics, so we are so glad that Christina joined us, cause otherwise, it's really hard for us to figure out how to do those kinds of analysis. I guess collaboration's good.  "
S276,I do research on infectious diseases and their control.  
S277,I am an epidemiologist. Yes.  I do research around prevention and control of infectious diseases
S278,The smallest projects you know two people.  
S279,The goal of my research is to find practical solutions for preventing infectious diseases and there impact to both animals and people.  
S280,"The largest projects, I dunno.  Thirty. "
S281,I am co-lead of that project. So co-pi if you will.  
S282,"I am responsible for, I lead in the grant, submission, and development. Development and submission.  "
S283,"for the most part I act at a level that's higher, that's more on the project development and oversight.  "
S284,"we are responsible for overseeing all aspects of the project from project design, to implementation, to overseeing the funding, the spending, the accountability of those items, the you know the deliverables, report preparation, disemination of information, both in a scientific and public context.  "
S285,I do a little bit where I'm a collaborator in the sense that I'm doing analysis or that's my principal role.  
S286,"Well, in general the work that I do which has a larger number of collaborators is more impactful and that's not necessarily driven by how many collaborators we have. It's kind of chicken and egg.  "
S287,. I cannot engage in larger impactful projects without bringing in scientists to help me adequately cover the knowledge base and deliverables. I cannot engage without having larger number of collaborators. 
S288,Working with larger number of collaborators leads to bigger ideas and those kinds of things  PID:.  
S289,I enjoy the research collaborations.  
S290,my primary motivation for doing science is not about prestige as a primary thing. It's not about the money or attention as a primary thing. It's about helping other people and enjoying it. And I enjoy working with people in that collaborative relationship
S291,The more people you bring in the harder it is to ensure that everybodys at the same level and same standard and those kinds of things. That's probably the biggest one.  
S292,"large You have to trust people that they will, they will come, that they will deliver on what they are supposed to do right?.  "
S293,"large There's always more people, more potential for conflict or more potential for disagreement and conflict may be the strongest. More potential for disagreement or whatever right I suppose.  "
S294,"smaller Yeah, they tend to be more personally in control of what's happening right?.  "
S295,the benefits of having a larger group. It's not all depending on me doing the work. I mean I'm busy I have lots of projects going. 
S296,"small for things to depend solely on me pushing this widget, you know across so many peoples desk. That can be hard for me because I've got so many things going on.  "
S297,About what percentage of your projects involve atleast one collaborator that is at another institution? (7:22)P13: 95%.  
S298,Why are you choosing to work with those collaborators? (7:40)P13: They're good scientists and I get along with them.  
S299,How do you go about meeting new collab? (7:48)P13: Social networks.  
S300,"Is there any instances where you're needing expertise from somebody and you don't necessarily know them? (7:57)P13: Not so much at other institutions. Once in awhile, yeah I can think of specific examples in, in my career. And almost inevitably it's lead to trusted relationships, friendships around those kinds of things. "
S301,"More often then not, when seeking people outside I reach to people I know, and trust already. It's not a blind date.  "
S302,"the things I look for in collaborators are getting along, being reliable and deliverable, being high quality scientists right? Those are the things that I need to do, need to have in an effective collaborative network.  "
S303,Being able to cast my net outside my immediate contacts in a location allows me to find those people good collaborators.  
S304,"So, it's as common to get to work on a new project with those people because we like to work with each other as it is for us to say hey here's a great idea and this widget fits into this hole and you're a widget you know? It has to do with.  "
S305,"And the people I collaborate with, they're not that I don't have friends at other institutions that are doing different things, but the people I collaborate with, working in the same area in, so.  "
S306,Have you ever had a project fail because of collaboration issues? (10:01)P13: Yeah.  
S307,"What happened? (10:07) failP13: People not doing their job, people creating conflict.  "
S308,"If they were sort of adhoc projects where there were not a lot of funding in place you know.  It was, then they would tend to fade away you know. "
S309,"If there was funding on the line and the project was centered here, I end up having to pick up the pieces for what they were doing. And it usually took longer. Sometimes we had to find additional funding because of those failures. fail"
S310,"Sometimes, and almost inevitably put publication of the research in jeopardy. And some of those projects, well they may have been completed, they've never been published. fail. "
S311,"If they were centered somewhere else, I'd just pull out you know? fail.  "
S312,"that's actually a huge consequence of graduate students not doing a good job, not following through. If the graduate student falls through and then it falls on to a busier person or busier, someone who's attention is spread out across more things. fail. "
S313,It puts the publications in jeopardy right? fail  PID:.  
S314,"I've had faculty, professors that have basically completely.  There's one in particular I can think of hasn't happened much more than that out of all of the people that I've worked with, but they really screwed up right? fail. "
S315,"It cost me like about $200,000 in wasted funding fail.  "
S316,When you're working with collaborators who are outside of your institution what roles are they playing in your research? (12:30)P13: Everything from facilitating the physical conduct of the research like sample collection or something like that to full fledged.  
S317,We collaborate in developing the ideas and trade on getting the funding or you know.  
S318,"I have collaborators who work for government agencies, so they have some control over disemination of funding and so you know.  "
S319,"There's few situations where I, where I ask people to do trivial things for me that we don't take it over ourselves or that we do feed for service things. We pretty much are self contained with people who participate in determining the course of the research.  "
S320,Are there any disadvantages or challenges working with people who are at a different institution? (14:11)P13: Not many really.  
S321,I have as close or closer relationships with people who are different places than I do with people who are across campus.  
S322,"There's people who I speak with, I can think of uh.  There, four, five people who are in different countries who I speak with basically on a weekly basis and we just"
S323,"That's true for redacted, collocated collaborator you know.  And I don't see him more frequently, well maybe a bit more frequently. "
S324,It's not that the technology around the ability to communicate and the ability to communicate and the ability to interact is so great these days that the distances around collaborating they're not that many.  
S325,"Well, even if they are out of the country or whatever I mean.  I meet very frequently so. "
S326,"My closest collaborators.  Daily. And for those, and then less frequently for those that I'm not as, we're not working as closely on a particular project or whatever"
S327,Does the frequency change due to location of your.  (16:03)P13: No. meeting freq
S328,I'm just as likely to communicate frequently who's someone in a different discipline as I am someone who's in my own discipline. And I'm just as likely to work closely with the same thing right? We're close to the people who do very similar things and people who do very different things.  
S329,"Well, yeah.  I think it expands possbility for that social network that reprofessionally social netowkr right? Or professional network I guess. To find additional great collaborators you know? So, somebody at a different institution that I work very closely with they know someone that they work very closely with and then that has brought them in to a professional network setting you know? And there have been a number of those right? distributed"
S330,"Now, proximity is relative too right? For someone who is down the hall, that has its advantages. You're working closely and you can bump into them or you can walk out of your office and go talk to them or whatever. That has advantages. "
S331,"So redacted and I are on the phone everday with each other, talking about various things and checking in an stuff. We're texting right? Everyday about research questions or things that are going on. So we're checking in all the time. That wouldn't be any different if he had an office next door  PID:"
S332,"So, it does sort of help, it helps in the ability to strengthen those, but it doesn't impede it. It doesn't eliminate the ability to be close in a professional and a collaborative relationship, it helps that he and I can sit in the same room and bullshit sometimes collocated.  "
S333,Who's in what location is a limiting factor right? Not everybody can be in the same location and so if I'm looking to work with the best or working with people I get along with whatever.  It just eliminates those possibilities collocated. 
S334,"What percentage of your projects involved collaborators who are in a different field? Not epidemiologists? (19:09)P13: Most of them, I mean.  There are people who do different things than I do right? I dunno. "
S335,"It goes through an individual personality, not to their disicpline right? So, some people believe what they do is most important as opposed to seeing the benefits of people bringing different things to the table.  "
S336,Some people who are work on different fields aren't interested in learning about what other people do.  
S337,"You can be in the same location and have conflicts about working together and that was not a collaborative situation per se, but it's about.  But it is about a collaborative situation right?. "
S338,"If we're in the same building, if we're in the same college, there's sort of a premise that we have the potentially, we should be working together, and here we are arguing about whether or not a cubicle has three walls or two walls okay?.  "
S339,"so we have quantitative things we do and statistics and so people will come and see that as you can do this. It's a little bit like saying as a microbiologist you can do this test for me. Now, they'll come to me and they'll see I want these statistics done this way and they have less expertise around it and when I try to explain or tell them that that's not the best way or that's not the approach then they're like ""no no no. "
S340,That's a little bit like me going to the microbiologist and saying well I need you to do this test and them having more expertise telling me that that's not the right way to do it and then me telling them no I want the incubator set at 65 degrees instead of you know.  It makes no sense that I would not use their full knowledge so. 
S341,"I guess it goes back to personality.  I mean there are people that are difficult to work with that are do what I do too. So it's really more, it's really more about the personality of the individual"
S342,"It's just the nature of science anymore. You know there's very few Louis Pasteur's out there that can just do their own thing about what they do like create their own space. It's just, I mean my research is has less impact. You can't do as much"
S344,"It's not the location, and it's not the size per se, it's the background, it's the mix of expertise that you need. biggest impact.  "
S345,"it starts with a research idea then we're looking for funding opportunity, so we maybe have or we may need to do this bit of work and then you know we'll probably not get way down the line developing a project until we understand that there's a target for doing the development around the research. That would be then you would get with your primary people that are the leaders in the development of the idea and you would figure out a goal and a scope right?.  "
S346,"generality of how this goes, you'd look at the budget, and figure out how much you could afford right, how big the project can be, and give you a good answer okay? And then you'd go back and go do the detailed design around what fits in to the box right? And also, it goes to that research idea may be turned a little bit depending on the, what we know about the funding agencies approach and what they will fund right? It really does, it gets what they fund and what the goals of that call are okay?.  "
S347,there might be video conferencing with Skype too right?.  
S348,"it's not location, it's whatever is the most efficient. communication method.  "
S349,And I could have a phone call.  
S350,It could be a teleconference with someone who's on campus you know? It just depends right?.  
S351,"mean there's no advantage to me really in a person to person over telephone call unless people are in proximity. For in proximity we might tend to get in a room together. I wouldn't have a, I wouldn't have a you know, I wouldn't have a telephone call for a detailed conversation with the guy's who's next door. I would go and talk to him, or even on campus"
S352,There's a little bit of a you know one-dimensionality of a phone call as opposed to the in-person thing.  
S353,And I'm finding myself reaching to Skype more. I don't typically do that in proximity.  
S354,"Because I'm not a millenial. It's a little bit generational. I mean there was no email, there were not cell phones when I was in college, when I was in graduate school right? I mean. "
S355,"Because I'm not a millenial. It's a little bit generational. I mean there was no email, there were not cell phones when I was in college, when I was in graduate school right? I mean. "
S356,"Are there any drawbacks to using the phone other than that one dimensionality? 00:29:21 No, and their are some advantages in that you find people where they are and they can talk in the car you know.  It doesn't have to have that proximity stuff. So yeah"
S357,"? If phone, if phone is one dimensional and email is half a dimension right?.  "
S358,"I'm a fast typer, but you know, for complex conversation or conveying a complex idea you know.  I'm not going to spend the time to write an email. I'm going to pick up the phone cause I can, cause I can say it right?"
S359,"And then email I have to, I'm editing, I'm working on typos,.  "
S360,"email and then there's always the context kind of a thing because people are shortcutting right? So, they can be misinterpreted, there can be misinterp-, it's harder to get complex ideas around and they can be, and their more likely like that they would have misunderstandings or miscommunication and email.  "
S361,The quickness of doing an email or a text and find myself multi-tasking in meetings and stuff like that and I can you know flip a quick note to someone right? As we're talking you know?.  
S362,"So, now there's a falacy right that multi-tasking is just as efficient as working in an individual subject and that is a fallacy right? They've shown that you actually do worse, you're less effective on both of the things that you're doing. But a bit of it is the reality of a busy life style.  "
S363,I would like to go back to a time when there wasn't even email let alone faxes or anything like that.  
S364,How often do you teleconference? P13: Everyday. Yeah.  
S365,"Any issue with teleconferencing? P13: Uh.  No, no. "
S366,Benefits to teleconferencing? 00:32:01 P13: Uh yeah.  It's easier to arrange a phone call than it is a face-to-face. 
S367,"So, we went to a meeting in Canada and they work in the government and you can't just use any, you can't just Skype, you have to use their secure video conferencing stuff and they have to send you an invitation and you, you know.  "
S368,"The technology around effective teleconferencing is not, it's more complex you know don’t use skype  PID:.  "
S369,You know the three words that go along with technology is: great when it works.  
S370,It doesn't work more often on videoconferencing than it does probably in any other thing that you are doing.  
S371,"Teleconferencing, teleconferencing you know, no big deal. You get multiple people on the phone and stuff okay?.  "
S372,"but videoconferencing you know, the bridge doesn't work, it you know, you know, you know, this thick connection is not at a high enough speed and so it buffers or you know.  "
S373,"And people don't know enough about the software, hardware to make their own adjustments. They have to have experts that are doing that for them.  "
S374,"if you're doing a desktop, one-to-one that's fine, if you're trying to do someone that's in a meeting room, those never works very well. You get a shot of this cavernous.  "
S375,There's not advantage of that over a telephone right? At that point.  sykpe.  
S376,So why do it? 00:34:06 P13: Exactly. Ha ha. When we get to the point where it is a bit more seamless. Cellphones used to be a bit like that too right? I mean
S377,"When we get to the point where it is a bit more seamless. Cellphones used to be a bit like that too right? I mean.  You drop towers blah blah blah When it gets to be a bit more seemless in terms of connectivity and it gets a bit more in terms of it doesn't matter what kind of phone you have, you're calling between them and it works just fine, as opposed to who's got what software and who's got what camera and who's got what microphone"
S378,"We didn't have harddrives on the computers we started using okay? They were floppy drives. Five and a quarter inch floppy drives okay? So, probably we'll lag a little bit in that adoption, but still I mean why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you shoot uh, why wouldn't I Skype to someone who's on campus as opposed to picking up the phone right?.  "
S379,"It's just you know, it's just familiarity. Not everybody has that, and it's not as common place.  "
S380,"What do you use to share data?Email, dropbox.  "
S381,Okay. When do you use email over using dropbox? 00:35:47 P13: Most of the time.  
S382,"The whole idea of sending invitation, people have that or whatever why he uses email over dropbox.  "
S383,"And their space limitations on dropbox because I'm too cheap to buy the professional thing so.  So, if I had a large cloud…. "
S384,"again not everyone has the same cloud, and not everyone has the same cloud server right? why he uses email over dropbox.  "
S385,"Versus an email, which it doesn't matter who's, it's just, it's universality right? I can send an email and it's going to go there.  "
S386,As long as the file isn't too big you know.  when to use email. 
S387,", we go all the way to the very large data sets and we're still using vpn. Oh, sorry not vpn, but ftp, sorry.  "
S388,"When do you use dropbox? 00:36:53 P13: When it's, when there's lots of things that have to be shared or we have to do some editing across multiple locations. Yeah, that's pobl.  You know"
S389,"Why not use, put it on a server and use ftp? 00:37:14 P13: Because most people don't know how to use ftp.  "
S390,"And dropbox is again, it's ease of use. You can drop it in, it's there, and you know most people can get that right?.  "
S391,"Have you ever had any issues using dropbox for sharing data? 00:37:28 P13: Yeah, version control.  "
S392,"people you know, people edit, well a couple things right? So, you got multiple versions and then who's editing what version, simultaneous editing of the same document would be another portion of that. It's not exactly version control, but you have the same issue. And then someone editing or deleting something that shouldn't happen right?. "
S393,"P13: Well, um.  Most people go in. "
S394,"What do you use to write your documents? 00:39:01P13: Well, word processor. Microsoft word.  "
S395,"Well, I used to use word perfect and it was a very die hard user of word perfect forever and ever and ever and ever and ever, but then the support just kind of dried up and everybody was using word.  "
S396,Microsoft made it very difficult to import word documents and so everybody else was using word and they couldn't use my word perfect files and so.  
S397,"Again, this is repeating a theme of difficulties in sharing data and you know communication stuff I think that it's a big deal.  "
S398,"The fact that everybody uses word, then when you're revisions you know, you know, draft, you know, track changes and that kind of thing. It's all you know.  You can do those"
S399,"It was hard when mac and, mac and pc versions didn't communicate well either.  "
S400,"Well, typically, somebody would draft a you know, first version or straw man document and then it would be sent.  "
S401,"there's two ways that some people do that: they'll disseminate to a lot of people and then pull there individual revisions into a document versus, and then there will be the round robin, it goes one, two, three, four people right?.  "
S402,"there's two ways that some people do that: they'll disseminate to a lot of people and then pull there individual revisions into a document versus, and then there will be the round robin, it goes one, two, three, four people right?.  "
S403,"With primary researchers with the people who have most impact on a particular document. Usually it's someone will revi, someone will revise and then another person will revise so you don't, someone doesn't have to pull everything in together.  "
S404,For people who are not as major of a contributor it's probably that disseminate.  
S405,So you'd probably do round robin to get it to a second draft right?.  
S406,"So first draft, then you get to second draft, then it would be disseminated.  "
S407,Getting responses back right? Everybody has to wait okay? round robin.  
S408,", the other one is like pulling all of those you know revisions into a single document. And there are ways to merge those, but they're, again they don't work so great when you have four or five people okay?.  "
S409,"So, I would, typically have that person go through and say right? So, some of these edits may be conflicting or whatever. You need to, you need to consolidate them you know? Draft, pick the one that you think is the best and make sure you tell me there's another, that there's another opinion out there and we'll go from there so.  It's really takes someone going line by line at various edits"
S410,", I guess we'd go back to this recurring theme that one of the reasons you know.  You use or don't use things is the universality of being able to use that, so it would have to be highly disseminated so that it is available to all kinds of people hypo. "
S411,"it was intuitive right? So, there.  It didn't have to have a special. "
S412,"It would talk to, universal in a sense either it would, it would merge, or it would mesh with other alternatives or it was the only thing people did okay hypo.  "
S413,It facilitated short communications well as long communications so text message versus an email right? hypoPID:   PID:.  
S414,"It would be transportable so you could do it on, you could use it on the road as opposed to sitting at your desk. hypo.  "
S415,It could be large group and small group right? hypo.  
S416,".  It could be text, voice, video kinda of all wrapped in to one. And you could choose how that would be used hypo"
S417,"Oh, sharing documents yeah. So sure, sharing documents kind of stuff would be, would be useful too right? hypo.  "
S418,"It wouldn't matter what kind of computer, what operating system you were working on. It would work the same way. You know. "
S419,You could use it online or offline. hypo.  
S420,.  I wouldn't have to pay for it. 
S421,That it had large capacity. I hate running into storage capacity issues. hypo. 
S422,"Or it interfaced with some way or backing up stuff on your machine you know.  That, you know it would take care of that hypo. "
S423,PID:.  
S424,Challenges and benefits are similar regardless of the size of the group.  
S425,Challenges - keeping everyone in the communication loop all collab.  
S426,Challenges - ensuring that everyone is completing tasks on time and on budget all collab.  
S427,Challenges - coordinating schedules for meetings all collab.  
S428,Challenges - often need to have contracts or agreements for sharing funding etc. which can be time consuming all collab.  
S429,Benefits- variety of expertise to ensure the best outcomes are achieved all collab.  
S430,"Benefits- opportunity for learning more about another area which helps you as a researcher get a broader picture of the issue you are investigating,  all collab.  "
S431,Benefits- results in new ideas and solutions being generated all collab.  
S432,"Benefits-, can achieve projects that you might not have been able to otherwise all collab.  "
S433,"Have you ever had concerns regarding security or trust when sharing data with collaborators? If so, what were your concerns?No I have not.  "
S434,I have been fortunate enough to have collaborated with people I know or have gotten to know through others that I have worked with and trusted in the past.  
S435,Some collaborative groups are not also instilling data and materials transfer agreement to ensure that each party is clear on what is permissible and what is not.  
S436,No I have never had a project fail due to collaboration issues.  
S437,If I am a lead or co-lead I will communicate with key members of the team maybe as regularly as weekly once the project is up and running.  
S438,if I have only a specific role (and I am under the leadership of others) meetings may only happen monthly or on an as needed basis.  
S439,Scope of the project likely has more to do with the level of communication needed than the size of the group or the background of the collaborators. The more complicated the project the more  regular communications need to be.  
S440,The biggest impact on the project outcome depends on each person being responsible for their role and completing it in the timeframe expected.  
S441,"Have you ever had concerns regarding security or trust when sharing data with collaborators? If so, what were your concerns?No, not in the sense of integrity.  "
S442,"I don’t always “trust” that a collaborator will have performed the work competently (especially when s/he is a student or otherwise inexperienced), and I sometimes feel compelled to check/verify work.  "
S443,"I have had many project “fizzle” because a collaborator did not end up doing something that we had planned on, and I was not invested enough to push it through.  "
S444,"I have had many project “fizzle” because a collaborator did not end up doing something that we had planned on, and I was not invested enough to push it through. I have guilty of this myself many times too — both in collaborative efforts and in projects that I am working on solo.  "
S445,The ultimate outcome is a bunch of half-analyzed datasets and half-done experiments lying around that will probably never be finished. failed project.  
S446,"Yes, it depends on the size of the group and their locations. meeting freq.  "
S447,"With student/postdoc projects (people in the lab), I meet a minimum of once per week.  "
S448,"For larger groups, I almost never meet that frequently (the only exception I can think of is the i5k genome consortium that held weekly conference calls).  "
S449,Greater distance also reduces the frequency of meeting/communication.  
S450,"As we discussed, most of collaborations have not involved people with fundamentally different backgrounds, but I think increasing differences in that respect also reduce frequency of meeting/communication.  "
S451,"For example, with our recent collaboration with redacted (on campus) for protein-structural analysis, we only checked in periodically (every couple months) to get input on the general direction.  "
S452,"Tough to quantify biggest impact, but my thought would be the disciplines/backgrounds. The whole point is whether people are bringing different skillets that interact synergistically.  "
S453,"Have you ever had concerns regarding security or trust when sharing data with collaborators? If so, what were your concerns?NO.  "
S454,"Have you ever had a project fail due to collaboration issues? If so, what happened? What was the ultimate outcome of the project?NO.  "
S455,How frequently do you meet with collaborators when working on a project? Typically every 1-2 months. PID:.  
S456,With off campus collaborators these meetings will be by phone conferences instead of in person.  
S457,"Which has the biggest impact on the outcome of a project: the size of the group, the locations of the collaborators, or the disciplines/backgrounds of the collaborators?Disciplines/backgrounds of the collaborators.  "
S459,00:00:29 currently I do computation microbiology.  
S460,00:00:36 the goal is to understand gene transfer with microbes that related to cheese.  
S461,oh I see ok so in that case it would be probably on the order of six to 8 current project # of collab.  
S462,probably yeah I would say 5 to 10 on my graduate work there were probably 10 people average # of collab.  
S463,I’m the lead researcher so I’m writing computer code I’m doing bench experiments I’m sort of going to be doing he writing of data interpretation. Plotting the course of the project so what experiments are important to do.  
S464,"I’m a post doc now so uh and when I was a graduate student it was the same thing. Doing the experiments designing, deciding on project directional DNA writing up the results and interpreting data and stuff like that.  "
S465,when there is some sort of expertise that you don't being able to reach out to a collaborator who does have that express is really valuable.  
S466,"That happened in my graduate work, the collaborators we had there were people who did things we didn't know how to do or do well.  "
S467,if you are in a bigger group you can become a slave to the will of the group rather than the do your own thing.  
S468,in the case of my current project the bioinformatics was not something I know how to do but I wanted to learn so it was useful for me to do it myself.  
S469,"to having small numbers? yeah I mean it’s easier to keep focus and control the direction, control your own interests.  "
S470,what roughly have your projects involved at least one collaborator who is at another institution00:06:13 I guess 100%  PID: `0.  
S471,why did you chose to work with these collaborators00:06:24 again they have expertise that we didn't have and either I or the pi knew them collab at other inst.  
S472,did you notice any differences when working with that person who you didn’t know vs. working with someone you knew more intimately00:07:07 the nature of the working together was different. The answer is not really but it’s hard to say because it was just a one off thing. 
S473,"are there any challenges or difficulties associated with working on projects where your collaborators are distributed00:07:24 um yes, so sometimes getting in touch with them or having people follow up with communication.  "
S474,if somebody is in close proximity you go and talk to them. but it they are distant you right them an email and they might not right back to you immediately if your priorities don't line up with yours it can be hard to sort of communicate the urgency of a request and communicate what is urgent.  
S475,if somebody is in close proximity you go and talk to them. but it they are distant you right them an email and they might not right back to you immediately if your priorities don't line up with yours it can be hard to sort of communicate the urgency of a request and communicate what is urgent.  
S476,"um I mean being able to find different expertise is the biggest benefit, you don't always have someone locally that knows a thing.  "
S477,right now a collaborator is at a different university that is also into the Boston metro area and is close by and can come over to you know exchange. But yeah their not like in the same building or same lab.  
S478,I mean being able to share reagents or strains of bacteria. Having them be able to come pick it up rather than shipping it is obviously a lot more convenient but against here’s it’s tough to say if it’s a function of them being closer.  
S479,Or because he used to be a post doc of the current lab. So the relationship is closer to begin with. It’s hard to say if the distance is causing the different in interaction. 
S480,what percentage of your projects involve working with collaborators that are in very different fields00:10:16 um I would say allow percentage may be 20 %.  
S481,"are there any challenges or difficulties associated with working on those projects heteroyes, the main difficulty is being not the same page as far as experimental questions go  PID:.  "
S482,go um a lot of jargon and sort of its not just jargon hetero.  
S483,Its different ways of thinking about approaching a problem and communicating that because it’s when you working with people in your own field it’s not really verbalized it’s not at explicit difference in thinking. So figuring out how to communicate.  
S484,sometimes you can use the same words with a person a have it means something different because of your field. So crossing figuring out that there is a communication barrier and getting around that barrier can be complicated.  
S485,so how do you approach solving that problem communicating hetero00:11:31 um lots of talking and using clarifying words and questions sort of you know being very explicit about what you’re looking for and asking if the other person is on the same page and sort of doing lots of back and forth.  
S486,are there any benefits to working with collaborators in different fields00:12:01 it’s important to get different prospective on a problem. That problem on having different ways of looking at a problem or a having different approaches to a thing can be really valuable. Even though it’s hard to get around it. Having different approaches if valuable
S487,Sometimes the approach you’re thinking of doesn’t work or it has issues that you can't see because of your own biases hetero.  
S488,Tunnel blindness you can get stuck on a certain problem and not realize there’s a different approach because everybody has the same background homo.  
S489,uh the communication is really easy. You all speak the same language. You don't spend a lot of time sort of making sure everybody understands. It’s usually pretty clear
S490,once every month or two meeting freq.  
S491,For really complex projects the I think there’s probably a sweet spot in terms of size. you need enough collaborators that you can effectively address all often experimental questions so you have the broad expertise that you need but not so big that it becomes sort of unwieldly from an organizational stand point.  
S492,I’ve heard stories of you have 30 peoples who have to sign off on a paper and waiting months to hear back from people that haven't read it or things like that. That can cause big delays.  
S493,in terms of different expertise I think that’s far more conditional I think these less you know depending on the project. Having people different expertise may cause problems or it might be the key to the success of it.  
S494,I think it would greater than 10 starts to get unwieldly if all of those people are in terms of collaboration making decisions. If they are doing a one off experiment and they get back to you but you don't have to consult with them for each step of the project. I’m talking people that are directly involved. 
S495,have you ever had a project fail because of collaboration issues00:18:15 no.  
S496,mostly in person meetings and email.  
S497,in person when we are both in the same place and email when we're not.  
S498,in person when we are both in the same place and email when we're not.  
S499,so in my current project for example I’m working in two different locations and so because it’s a computation project I’m on the computer so I can do the work from 2 different locations and so when we’re not in the same building I’ll use email and she late or she’s not I have a thought I’ll send an email.  
S500,if she’s in the lab then you know then we’ll chat in person.  
S501,so what is the benefit to talking in person over email00:19:43 um quicker back and forth so the speed of communication. So if there’s something that isn't understood or there’s a response it come immediately.  
S502,are there any times when you would choose to use email over talking in person00:20:05 when I choose email? I can't think of one.  
S503,things like skype so google hangouts. We tried using whatever the apple version of that face time once. Um it doesn't really matter they all sort of accomplish the same thing. 
S504,also use trello. it an organizational frame work it’s a web app where you have lists of task and you can write things down and have check lists and different organizational structure.  
S505,So when we like plot out the direction of a think we lay it out in trello and we can put comments on things and like mark when their done.  
S506,why do you use trello specifically over other alternatives?00:21:38 just cause it was a thing that I found and it seemed to work.  
S507,user the learning curve is a little steep figuring out how to use it effectively would be kind of I mean that’s not uncommon with trying to figure out a different way of organizing different information trello.  
S508,so what did you do to overcome issues with trello00:22:09 um I think I like watched some tutorial videos and also experimentation so trying some methods and seeing if they work and refining.  
S509,I only use it with my pi trello.  
S510,I would never use it over talking in person unless we were in different locations and couldn't meet in person. skype/hangouts/facetime.  
S511,for example over the summer my pi was up at um we study cheese so we have collaborators who are chees makers and she was up in Vermont for a couple of weeks. And we wanted to have meeting and we used that. skype/hangouts/facetime. 
S512,sometimes the video doesn't work or the audio doesn't work.  
S513,so you're basically using these to speak to people at a distance?00:24:24 right.  
S514,would you use hangouts with one collaborator and FaceTime with another?I can say hypothetically I would I my collaborator had a preference for one or the other.  
S515,my personal default is hangouts.  
S516,I tend to be more technically savvy than collaborators so I will default to whatever they are using.  
S517,. I think we tried face time because my collaborator my pi was having trouble with hangouts.  
S518,"I think her microphone, she couldn't get audio working.  "
S519,an in person conversation you can have more direct back and forth.  
S520,I think I would mostly use email for specific communication. Where there’s a particular goal or question or um some very specific issue.  
S521,I think meetings are valuable for general updates on the state of a project or general talk about the direction of a project. So where there’s where there are a lot more directions where the conversations might go.  
S522,go I think if you not into the same location have a skype or in hangouts conversation is better than email because you can sort of deal with different threads as they come up.  
S523,Therese no time that I can think of that I would  use teleconferencing or phone call.  
S524,if a collaborator was not technically savvy and did not know how to use hangouts then a phone call would be the next best thing.  
S525,clarifying things with collaborators mostly in person communication.  
S526,other I think it’s a matter of communication and back and forth so again you can do that more rapidly in person.  
S527,email can be better writing things out to be better and spend more time with the topic.  
S528,problems where there’s this sort of jargon barrier or language barrier and you can say a word and have it not be clear that it means something different to the other person. um but that’s hard to catch in email too.  
S529,I guess it’s just that you can re-read things in email and you can pick up things that you might miss in person.  
S530,the act of doing the experiment is solitary. I mean again you communicate about the direction of it and collaborate on that but individual experiments are usually solitary.  
S531,what tools do you use to share your data00:29:52 um having turn around and look at my computer screen or email or google drive.  
S532,what tools do you use to share your data00:29:52 um having turn around and look at my computer screen or email or google drive.  
S533,uh I think google drive is superior in most ways.  
S534,though if it’s just sort of a one off they look at this thing I think email is often easier.  
S535,we try to keep most of the data in the lab in google drive.  
S536,ok can you elaborate on the superiority of google drive00:30:33 just because it’s a more permanent thing  PID:.  
S537,ok can you elaborate on the superiority of google driveif you are good about organizing folder structure then it’s a little easier to find than using search terms in your email client.  
S538,ok can you elaborate on the superiority of google drivebut also you can get larger files. I mean we deal with some multi gig files. You can't do that by email or it’s not practical. 
S539,ok can you elaborate on the superiority of google drivebut also you can get larger files. I mean we deal with some multi gig files. You can't do that by email or it’s not practical. 
S540,under 10 typically although a data set might be more than 10 gig.  
S541,I’m pretty stingy about data so if I do a thing and then I decide I don't like the results and I don't like it then I’ll just delete it rather than pack ratting the data. We definitely have some duplications of sequence files. Therese probably a lot of sever space that we are using that we don't actually need. 
S542,how do you share large data00:32:32 often google drive.  
S543,Harvard has a high performance computer cluster and network storage where we have I think like 100 terabytes so pace that um so we can upload to that and use ftp and other things.  
S544,I think we are transitioning to mostly use google drive for things.  
S545,what is the benefit of using google drive vs. ftp?user interface I think um I have become comfortable with command line but most of my collaborators still are not so um having a sort of easy web interface or being able to download it directly to your own computer and have it mirror for the files that you need is helpful.  
S546,we were using drop box for a while. I don't remember why my pi made the decision to switch to google drive. maybe for the document editing functions. 
S547,I think my pi just got a new job at cu san Diego and I think they are giving her free google drive basically unlimited google drive storage.  
S548,What tool do you use to write your documents?00:34:18 uh I typically use google docs.  
S549,I haven't learned how to use latex. I had intended to at one point but in my field we don't do a lot of mathematical display its mostly text and then rasterized or scalable vector graphic images and so the function of latex forum print out put or not is necessary.  
S550,In terms of use over Microsoft word I think that the direct cloud back up is nice. I’m always connected to the internet for the most part and I have offline so for those rare times that I’m not. It’s a little bit less cumbersome. google doc
S551,I don't need a ton of customization and Microsoft word is kind of bloated with functions I don't need.  
S552,typically its sort of I’ll write a draft and I’ll have people edit the draft.  
S553,I will say that when I was a graduate student my boss didn't really know how to use google drive and I’d share things with him on google drive and then earn google docs and he would download it as word files and do track changes and then send them back to me as word documents.  
S554,I think the one of the key benefits one of the nice benefits of google docs is the version history that is really seamless and not in the way.  
S555,with Microsoft word you can do track changes. but what ends up happen in is that you have like 5 or 10 versions of the document and it’s not always clear what version cam when and I if I sent him a version and made some edits and he made some edits and then sent those to me. Sort of merging would become a problem. 
S556,can you elaborate on why or how merging is an issue00:37:14 just making sure that all of the updates are containedMicrosoft word.  
S557,. If he makes suggestions about a word change. he either have you working with 2 versions of a thing you have to sort of say ok which version am I going to work on his track changes version or on my most recent version Microsoft word. 
S558,moving the changes or suggestions he made from his version to mine is a bigger hassleMicrosoft word  PID:.  
S559,and if we were collaborating on the same document at a time and has make suggestions as I’m editing a defend version and everything is sort of contained as opposed to having multiple file versions in different versions google doc.  
S560,Keeping track is much more complicated when you have multiple versions running around.  
S561,with my former pi who didn't know how to use google drive I would I started out sending him a link to the google doc but he didn't know how to use it so I basically um google drive has an option where its send as attachment and so I would within google docs say send as attachment and attach it as a word document.  
S562,with my current pi she is well versed in using google drive so I will just share the document with her and give her edit permissions so that she can make edits or suggestions.  
S563,so one of the difficulties was because we have these many many multi gig file and I’m using my laptop for most of my stuff…. once I have the lab drive shared with me if I tried to download or sync everything than I would fill up my computer hard drive google doc.  
S564,so sorting out which folders to sync um became an issue because of the way that I organize my folder structure the google drive only give you how to describe this the level of selectivity only download certain folders. You can only choose top level folders.  
S565,so in other words in my normal google drive structure I have person work and web are my top level drives so my all of my work stuff for the courses I teach is in my work folder and my lab stuff is also in my work folder but if I wanted to download all of my courses it would also try to download the entire lab drive. So I had to sort of work with like folder aliases to organize. I can selectively download only the things that I wanted to and figuring out how to do that was a pain. 
S566,usually since I’m the first person to see the data I will do my own interpretation and then for things that I think are important I will share that and then some additional interpretation is done with pi.  
S567,either I’m showing an image if I’ve generated a graph or a plot I’ve got an image it she's in the lab I’ll have here come to my computer and look at it and or I email it or put it on the google drive and send a link.  
S568,either I’m showing an image if I’ve generated a graph or a plot I’ve got an image it she's in the lab I’ll have here come to my computer and look at it and or I email it or put it on the google drive and send a link.  
S569,either I’m showing an image if I’ve generated a graph or a plot I’ve got an image it she's in the lab I’ll have here come to my computer and look at it and or I email it or put it on the google drive and send a link.  
S570,either I’m showing an image if I’ve generated a graph or a plot I’ve got an image it she's in the lab I’ll have here come to my computer and look at it and or I email it or put it on the google drive and send a link.  
S571,I’m usually sharing a somewhat interpreted data so a graph or an image and so if it’s something that I think is going to be close to f finally version or is a final version then that will go into the google drive.  
S572,If it’s something that we are still iterating on or still processing data will usually be in email just because that’s faster.  
S573,The thing that I was mentioning that the problem with email is finding it. If it’s just one step in the process then it’s not super important to be able to go back and find data.  
S574,. I think maybe email just feels faster than uploading it to the drive data.  
S575,I’m of the opinion that all data should be shared with everyone all the time and so I would be comfortable making all of my data public like as I collect it um but most of my colleagues wouldn’t.  
S576,I guess you know the universal translator on star track if you could do that but where it interfaced with the brain of the person to the point where it would translate any jargon that the other person didn't understand or would translate different meaning.  
S577,I mean really what we need is a direct brain link up so that we can experience what the other person can experience but that’s pretty far off.  
S578,"My goal is to figure out the molecular mechanisms underlying hormone perception, which control plant development. -P15.  "
S579,the hormone that i study is called oxen and its a really potent growth regulator and currently oxen is on the market and in a couple different forms as very strong herbicide so its commonly used in agricultural settings to control usually weeds.  
S580,". by understanding how the chemical, which is produced normally by plants, effects different aspects of plant growth and development. it can be important for agricultural uses that would be further down stream. "
S581,"lets see, currently I have one person here at ISU, I've got two collaborators at UCSD. Lets say three total current #.  "
S582,I guess I would be the lead investigator; I am the one designing experiments and actually for the most part doing them.  
S583,"For these collaborators, in one instance it’s my former post doc advisor so he is sort of a collaborator because the project was started in his lab.  "
S584,"For these collaborators, For the other researchers I am utilizing a technique that they are kind of experts in.  "
S585,So I would guess probably on average two general #.  
S586,I would say the smallest is probably one.  
S587,the largest would be a group of probably four.  
S588,"Usually I’m the lead investigator for these projects, so in charge of designing the experiments and doing any experiments.  "
S589,usually the other collaborators have a particular technique or particular experiment that is part of the entire project but they are not kind of over seeing it.  
S590,", lately all of my projects have involved a collaborator in another place.  "
S591,why collab at other inst Usually because they have a particular expertise that is required for the project.  
S592,why collab at other inst and I also usually knew them in some other capacity. So they were like a colleague at a former institute or I had met them at a meeting or I knew them through other science people or friends.  
S593,Sort of a combination of being familiar with them and then also that they had an area of expertise that was perfect for the project.  
S594,"I usually talk around to colleagues, read papers, send emails out to people, just try to get in touch one way or another when doesn’t already know someone who has specific expertise.  "
S595,I think that people you don't know in some other capacity or you don’t have an established relationship with; it can be more difficult to keep in touch with those people.  
S596,"I have had a couple collaborations where initially the contact was really good, either via email or in person meetings or doing experiments together. But then the collaborations just kind of lost communications strangers.  "
S597,But then the collaborations just kind of lost communications. I guess most because it was via email. You just didn’t talk to those people much anymore and that kind of stalls the collaboration. strangers
S598,"Where I have had other collaborations where I have a more established relationship with the people, before the collaboration starts and so communication tends to continue throughout and I don’t know if that is the nature of the project or the particular people involved, its hard to say.  "
S599,"I have had one, which partially failed, but there was still another component to it, so hopefully the whole thing won’t be a total whipeout.  "
S600,I think that's mostly because I have been persistent to try to make things work one way or another.  
S601,Basically the quality of the data that was generated by the collaborator was really poor and its not going to be able to be published. And because they specialize in a particular technique to generate that data I am not going to be able to go back and redo it or find somebody else to do it.  
S602,. I think that happens sometimes we're just relying on somebody else to do something and for whatever reason it just doesn’t have the same quality that you need.  
S603,"communication is the number one challenge. I feel like it is always easier to you know, discuss results, to present material, to trouble shoot, if it is done in person dist.  "
S604,Or on a phone call it might not be that great. with multiple people.  
S605,So I would say communication is the one thing. You just can’t replace face time in that instance.  
S606,When you see people all the time you are more apt to be sort of thinking about the project and working on it more actively versus if their not physically in the same space I think. They are not necessarily on your radar in the same way.  
S607,"So the benefits of collaboration are pretty extensive, I mean most life sciences especially in biology is very collaborative these days its a very interdisciplinary type of approach which is kind of going on across the board.  "
S608,collaborations are pretty much necessary because you got to have people with different training and expertise and also different opinions.  
S609,because people from different disciplines or even sub disciplines will have different ideas that can really help bring a new kind of you know kind of level to a project.  
S610,"I would say new learning is the other thing, you also continue to learn, ideally if you have good collaborators.  "
S611,"I would say mostly networking usually because it provides you a connection at other universities, which might have different resources, or different you know, focus or things like that are different from what your institution has. dist.  "
S612,", if collaboration continue for grant proposals it can be very beneficial to have more than one PI at a different institution.  "
S613,"Sometimes gives more credit to the whole collaborative type goals which is pretty important for some, I mean for some grant proposals it is actually required that you have people at different places.  "
S614,I would say that projects move a lot faster collocated.  
S615,"You have more face time with people, its easier to trouble shoot, and everybody gets to have I would say easier communication because you can get together in meetings and you can talk about ideas collocated.  "
S616,and their is just more opportunities to meet and discuss and to keep things moving collocated.  
S617,And a lot of that sometimes is just spontaneous collocated meetings.  
S618,some of its just easier to schedule because you are at the same place at the same time collocated meetings.  
S619,"Challenges are always, I would say mostly a result of everybody's priorities not being the same for a particular project dist.  "
S620,One collaborator may really want a particular bit of data compared to another collaborator maybe wanting something else for a project. dist.  
S621,"Which I think is just the nature of any project that has you know, different people working on it with different opinions. Not everybody can see eye-to-eye all at the same time dist?.  "
S622,I would say about maybe 50% of my collaborations involve people in not plant biology.  
S623,"I mean I think new learning, networking, bringing expertise, to a projects, those things are all kind of the main benefits working with people in different fields.  "
S624,"I mean I think new learning, networking, bringing expertise, to a projects, those things are all kind of the main benefits working with people in different fields.  "
S625,"I mean I think new learning, networking, bringing expertise, to a projects, those things are all kind of the main benefits working with people in different fields.  "
S626,its intellectually stimulating to you know to work with people who have totally different training and approach a problem totally different from how I might.  
S627,"I think it can be difficult to explain ideas and I think it can be difficult to explain technical details just because, you know, either side doesn’t have the complete expertise of what the other person is more familiar with. hetero.  "
S628,When I am actively working on a project I like to touch base with collaborators at least weekly.  
S629,"There have been projects where the communication has been like, you know, maybe once a month.  "
S630,There has been a time when the communication has been daily.  
S631,Just depending on what stage the project is in meeting freq.  
S632,"ideally for an ongoing collaboration at least a weekly touches base is what I prefer, it makes me most comfortable.  "
S633,"I would say that is somebody is further away, or maybe not that, either involved or understanding in the project then I would say the communication can drop considerably and go months before you hear anything back from people.  "
S634,"I would say probably backgrounds because backgrounds probably relates to how well aligned everybody goals are with the project I mean for me, that seem to be where the investment comes in. like how invested somebody is in the collaboration, seeing it all the way through. impact. "
S635,I would say background is probably most important. That people have somewhere aligned similar interests in order to make the whole collaboration come together.  
S636,so you might send samples to somebody else to process in a particular technique that they are really good at doing.  
S637,you might take samples to the collaborator and then learn how to do the technique.  
S638,"usually there is some sort of like sharing of samples and biological materials and then performing various experiments to, you know look at all kinds of things from the cellular level up to the organismal level.  "
S639,Usually access to a server data sharing.  
S640,in some cases I have actually sent a hard drive to someone or they have given me a drive with data on it already data sharing.  
S641,I use dropbox a lot data sharing.  
S642,sometimes email usually not a lot. data sharing.  
S643,I am more prone to put stuff on drop box just because of the size of the files data sharing.  
S644,sometimes for security reasons email is not really a great idea data sharing.  
S645,"sometimes people are not familiar with it and so they you know, might have some technical things they need to figure out to use it dropbox.  "
S646,"I personally have never had any issues, usually been able to enough storage and get everybody access and edit and all that just fine dropbox.  "
S647,"I personally have never had any issues, usually been able to enough storage and get everybody access and edit and all that just fine dropbox.  "
S648,Right now I tend to use it heavily because I don’t actually have access to a server at ISC. Although that will probably change soon dropbox.  
M1,I have a faculty appointment but it’s a non-tenure track faculty appointment so it’s different than if you talking to a traditional faculty member.  
M2,so all of my research is tied to the core facility and what we do is biological mass spectrometry and so it is a little bit unique because we are generating very large amounts of data.  
M3,So our goal is basically to support whatever research people need.  
M4,"broadly our goal is typically to determine biological molecules that are indicative of whatever the experimental design is. So if they're trying to determine what's changing between, you know, a control population and a diseased population, then our goal would be to use our analytical methods to determine which compounds or molecules are different.  "
M5,"So again, the types of projects we work on are so broad, but some of them, you know, we have some projects that are looking for basically diagnostic biomarkers of a given disease.  "
M6,"Some of the research that we do in our lab specifically is focused on improving our ability to get to that answer, so improving the data analysis workflows, for example, so that we can take that data that we generated, generate, and translate that to something that's biologically meaningful for the researchers.  "
M7,"All the things you personally have worked on? So not just, you know, in your group, or what you've done here, butRight. Ok, so I might say on average four to five?.  "
M8,"Oh yeah, so, you know, a small project might be one person in my group working with one other person, so that would be two. Or two people in my group working together. And then, you know, larger projects definitely, probably, you know, ten to twelve. "
M9,"Ok. So are there any differences, have you felt any differences in working with smaller groups vs larger groups to do research? Pros and cons, so to speak?I don't, I mean there certainly are differences, but I don't know if there are pros and cons to each, to either;.  "
M10,"I mean, usually the size of the group is dictated by what the project needs.  "
M11,"the projects that are more interdisciplinary and that require lots of areas of expertise, tend to be bigger, because that's what the project needs. And the projects that are more focused tend to be kind of one person working with one person. So I don't know that there's a disadvantage or an advantage to either situation. I don't know if I would say that"
M12,"So, within my group, we might have a project, and then we'll have one person who's the project lead, and then we'll have other people within the group that might be handling sample preparation, another person that might be handling the data acquisition and another person that might do the data analysis, and sometimes the same person is doing multiple tasks.  "
M13,"And then we usually have the collaborator, whose, whose research it is, and they are, you know, maybe the biologist who's driving, who's designing the experiment from the biology point of view. Then we typically help them design, make that fit with how, with a good analytical design.  "
M14,"So, and then, on their end, there's usually a PI, and then someone underneath them that's doing the experimentation part in terms of whatever they're doing, collecting the samples, or whatever.  "
M15,"And so my role on the project then, is as the project lead for our group, in terms of managing the project, managing the funding for the project, and then managing the, you know, making sure that everything's happening as it should, and that the communication between our group and the other group is happening.  "
M16,"And within my group, I have sort of someone who's managing on the next level, the actual data acquisition. And then they have another person helping them with some of the hands-on sample prep running the instruments collecting the data. Then the data goes back to that, to the manager, the lab manager, and then they work it up, and then we all work together to put together the final report and present it to the collaborator. "
M17,"Oookaay. So kind of moving, moving a little, a little bit away from that you mentioned this; what percentage would you say of your projects involve at least one collaborator who's at a different institution? Rough, rough?Thirty percent.  "
M18,"I'm gonna answer that question very differently than a traditional faculty member, because, you know, we are a service facility and what that means is that we are essentially like a small business within the university and so we need to support ourselves. And so the external collaborations are people who have come to us through various means and ask for our services. We haven't gone to them to initiate a collaboration. "
M19,"so we actually are serving as the expert for these people outside the university that are looking for specific expertise, so they come to us, typically.  "
M20,I think a lot of people find us through our website.  
M21,"And as we've grown, and established ourselves in this field we get a lot of referrals. And people finding us because we've worked with somebody else.  "
M22,"And then they've heard, or have read our papers and they find us that way, and we've, I've met them at an event where I've given a talk, for example, or at a conference. And so we do, we make an effort actually to do this sort of external marketing, if you will, to put ourselves out there to these external potential users because they help support the facility.  "
M23,"And it also broadens our impact and gets us engaged in projects that we might not otherwise do if we were just focused on CSU, and so then that increases our expertise and lets us bring that knowledge back here.  "
M24,"So are there any other additional, you just mentioned a bunch of benefits to working in these kind of, distributed groups. Are there any additional benefits?To working in distributed groups?To work with people who are external. Well, they pay more. "
M25,", the more people we work with outside of CSU, it just, it gets our name out there more, it increases our credibility, it exposes us to different thing and different projects again that just builds our repertoire of things we can do and types of projects that we've worked on and then it helps us support the facility and keep moving forward and staying current with technology and things like that.  "
M26,"I mean there are always difficulties in the sense that, you know, there's a value with sitting down with someone and talking face-to-face.  "
M27,"And so we have collaborators, for example, we have some strong, some very strong collaborators in Sweden that we've been working with for, gosh, six or seven years now, and I would say that for the first three years that we were working with them, we never met them.  "
M28,"We never, we didn't know what they looked like, we did everything via the phone and email correspondence, but then at some point we made an effort: they came to visit us, we went to visit them, and that has, I think, strengthened the collaboration.  "
M29,"Just having that personal connection and being able to know, you know, to talk to someone face-to-face and see what their world looks like and they see what our world looks like and I do think it strengthens the collaboration.  "
M30,"Have you ever tried using something like Skype, or.  ?We have; you know, I find it a little bit cumbersome"
M31,"We do a lot of phone conferences, but we have not taken that step to doing Skype, and maybe we should, but we haven't and we do it when people ask us if they want to.  "
M32,"Like, we've been able to very successfully navigate those situations. I think the only time it's, that I would say It's been a big disadvantage is when we've been working with people where there's a language issue, and I personally have a hard time, I have a, if I'm talking to someone face-to-face, I have a better time understanding them than if they're on the phone.  "
M33,"Yeah, so these would be for example Chinese collaborators who are speaking English, but they're very, there's still this issue that they're difficult to understand.  "
M34,"So we have some collaborators in China, and we have to schedule phone conferences at very odd times because of the time difference, and so we have not done Skype with them, everything's been a phone conference and I have a very hard time.  "
M35,"I have to ask them to repeat themselves a lot, and I think we have had some miscommunications, and so it's almost been better to communicate with them via email than over the phone, just because of that.  "
M36,"And then, what percentage of your projects involve working with collaborators who are in very different fields, and by that I mean something like.  Almost all of them"
M37,"That's kind of our purpose, right, is that we're the analytical piece and most of the people that come to us come to use because they're not analytical people and they don't, and so pretty much every project we work with is someone coming from a different field that's not.  mass spectrometry, which is basically our field"
M38,"Well, it's not a difficulty, but it's always a challenge for us to, well, to understand their project because there's so many projects and they're all different, and so that's always a challenge, and then for us to figure out how to communicate our technology and our approach and the results to them in a way that they can process and get value out of.  "
M39,"So, that is, we spend a lot of time explaining the technology to people who are going to be using it.  "
M40,"I would say, of a given project, it's ten to twenty percent of the time is spent communicating with them, either the initial them communicating their project needs and then us communicating back and forth.  "
M41,"Well, there are certainly benefits to that, because it's just another view, another person's perspective to a problem, and coming to it, and they're adding their brainpower to the problem basically. And so there's definitely huge advantages of that, I would say.  "
M42,there's always an initial project discussion/consultation that usually starts with an email exchange and then we usually progress to either a phone conference if they're not local or a face-to-face meeting to discuss their project.  
M43,"so because we're a fee-for-service type of lab, we'll say this is how we propose to approach your problem, your experiment, and this is what it will cost for us to do it for you.  "
M44,"there's more communication to coordinate the timing and how they're gonna deliver their samples to us, and when that's going to happen. And making sure we get all the data that we need about those samples, so that we can do that experiment appropriately, you know, metadata that goes along with them.  "
M45,"And then once those samples are in our group, then within our own group, there is delegation of who's going to, you know, receive the samples, make sure that they get stored appropriately, and then who's going to process them and get them ready to analyze, and then who's going to analyze them, and then when that analysis is done, who's going to process data, and then when the analysis is done, who's, someone has to generate a report,.  "
M46,"we send the report, and then we go, and then we have a, another consultation meeting to go over the results with the researcher. And then again, that is either by phone or face-to-face if they're local.  "
M47,"And then usually the researcher goes back and they digest it, and then they usually come back, or oftentimes they come back and have follow-up questions, that we'll handle.  "
M48,"Sometimes they'll come back and ask us to do something different with the data, so we might re-analyze the data, and then that process starts over.  "
M49,"And then, ultimately, if the experiment was successful, then they might decide to publish it, in which case then we usually are involved in that process at some level depending on how engaged we were in the project, we might be co-authors on the paper, in which case we'll be very engaged in the manuscript preparation,.  "
M50,"And then sometimes that might be data that leads to a, maybe it's preliminary data that they're using for a proposal, and then we may be further engaged with them in terms of helping to write the proposal.  "
M51,"and sometimes, we might have only been peripherally involved, and so we might just be engaged in the sense of giving them a method section so they can include the appropriate methods in the paper.  "
M52,"Yeah; they contact us via email, they say, ""I have this project, I'm interested in doing this"".  "
M53," and so we'll usually ask them a few basic questions so we can get a general idea of what they want to do, and then we suggest we talk about it, either on the phone; have a conversation about it, so we can more fully understand what their goals are. Cause oftentimes, it changes once we have that conversation.  "
M54,.  
M55,.  
M56,"Why switch to phone?Well, because it's a lot easier to, you know, flesh it out when you're talking with someone in a live conversation.  "
M57,Sometimes the emails just tend to get cumbersome.  
M58,"we just had an example of this where, I was emailing with someone, and he was describing what he thought he wanted to do, and then I suggested a phone conference, we had a phone conversation yesterday, and by the end of the conversation, we had a really good plan in terms of what we, how we wanted to approach the problem, but it was much different from what he initially had in his email.  "
M59,"And so sometimes, it’s just about understanding, them understanding, the type of approach we might take, and us understanding what they're really trying to get at, and figuring out the best way to get there.  "
M60,"Oh, no, there's usually multiple people on the phone.  "
M61,"I mean, just sometimes, you know, people talk over each other, and so you don't have that eye contact thing, but typically they work pretty well.  "
M62,"So we have a whole pricing structure and for the types of analysis that we do, and so, and we use QuickBooks, which is an accounting software.  "
M63,Budgeting is a hard thing.  
M64,"Well, so, I have a business manager, and she has developed all of these, she's going through and done costing for all the different types of activities that we do.  "
M65,"We'll tell here this is the experiment we want to do, and she will use these pre-determined numbers and come up with an estimate for how much these projects will cost. And then we'll work with her to fine-tune that, we'll generate a document, and then we'll add the science to it, and then we'll send it back to the collaborator.  "
M66,"So she actually is, she's on my staff, but she works remotely, so she lives in Salida, and so we communicate via email and phone, and then she's on campus once a month, but most of the time it's via email and phone that we're communicating.  "
M67,"The project management platform, it's a web based company so you pay, like, a subscription, we pay so many, so much per month, it's not that expensive. But, we started using it about a year and a half ago as we started getting, you know, we have a lot of projects like, sixty, seventy, going on at the same time, and so it becomes very difficult to keep track of all of them.  "
M68,"So the software program, the accounting software program that we use has a template, and so it generates them, an estimate based on this template. And so I should mention at this point that we do use a software program called Teamwork.  "
M69,"So we'll create a summary document there with the notes from the meeting. And then if we create a project proposal, it will be attached to that project in Teamwork.  "
M70,"And then, we'll communicate with our business manager about the cost and then she can, she can upload the estimate in there. So it's all connected.  "
M71,"it doesn't always work, when she's completed that task, she will go into that project and say this task has been completed, so that if someone else needs to do the data acquisition, that's ready and they can do that.  "
M72,"for me, as sort of the overall lab lead, it's a way for me to go in, so if someone calls and says, ""where's this project at"", you know, ""can you tell me"", it's project two out of sixty-five, I can go in and look it up and say, it looks like the samples have been processed, and they're in the queue for this or whatever.  "
M73,"I do think that software like that, project management software, actually could be very valuable for the individual research lab, in terms of just keeping; I know that even as regular PIs, that I know have a hard time keeping track of all the different projects, because they might have one student working on this project, one student working on.  and it becomes difficult to keep track of what everyone's doing"
M74,"Another nice thing is that it can send, you can have it send you reminders so like, ""Remember, you should update this person on the status of their project"" so it will ping you with an email reminder, and also our business manager can go in and she can look at the project and say, is this project, ""can I invoice this person for the cost of this project, are you done?"" And so she can use it to kinda keep track of who she should be going after to get money, so we can continue to have our cash flow.  "
M75,"So it's really easy to, you know, when you have that many project, you can't be thinking about all of them all the time. And so, typically, or in the, what started to happen is that the people, the collaborators, the users or whatever, that were loudest and who called us every day asking where their data was tended to get the priority of our brainpower.  "
M76,"And so we would forget about someone who was just patiently waiting, and then, but then that would usually come back to bite us.  "
M77,"And so it was just easy to forget, not intentionally, but ""Ugh, I forgot to tell them, you know, that where their project's at"" or ""I totally forgot I was supposed to do this analysis for so-and-so"",.  "
M78,"everything's there and it's almost like a todo list, and then you can create actually your own todo list from which projects you are associated with, and that, so that's the intention. But it's a little, I think it's definitely working, but it's a little bit of changing people's habits to get used to using it.  "
M79,"No, no. So all that's captured there is for the project, like the project description, maybe the costing, what was done. But then we have, the broad data and the results are stored externally. "
M80,"Well, we have, right now, we have our own servers that we manage and that are being stored. It's most likely that's gonna have to change. Why?Because we generate too much data. "
M81,"So, most, we're constantly upgrading that and probably will eventually go to some sort of cloud-based storage system as that becomes more affordable.  "
M82,"So why switch to cloud?Well I think ultimately it will be more, it'll be more secure and more scalable and it should become more affordable. Cause we just keep running out.  "
M83,"So, it works now. We do not have a LIMS system, so we don't have like a system that we can search and find things, so we just have a system, you know, a method of organized by the name of the person whose project it is and when it was done.  "
M84,"And then sometimes we do have some collaborators where we have to give them a lot of data and then we usually do that by, we set up an FTP site, and we do a transfer. Actually, sometimes we do that when the data's too big for email, but not really sort of in the middle area, we have an account out with the company.  "
M85,"Hightail. It's basically a document delivery company, so we can post a file and then our collaborators can go and download it. And we have so much space and files are active for so long, right, then they disappear. "
M86,"Well, cause the FTP is not really that user-friendly. Like you kinda have to go in and open your FTP server and the other person has to do it and configure it and it's kinda clunky.  "
M87,"Whereas with the middle ground one, it's an email. And they just get a link and it takes them to the site and they click Download. But that is still cumbersome, if I'm just sending someone an Excel file, than just opening an attachment on their email. "
M88,"A lot of it is whatever the project dictates, like this project needs this type of work so it, that, because of the person who's doing that type of work, they just get delegated. Or sometimes we discuss it in group meeting who's going to do what on a meeting, as a group.  "
M89,"We only have group meeting every other week. So sometimes the projects that come up we might say, but then it might be me talking with, you know, my associate director or him talking with me saying, ""who should we have work on this project?"", and then we'll make the decision, just give it to me.  "
M90,"I mean I guess people we've been working for a long time, they sometimes we'll just send them their data, and they've seen it enough times that they'll know how to interpret it. But most of the times, especially with the new collaborators, they need some additional walking through. They need to walk through, someone to walk through the data with them. "
M91,Track changes? Okay. So are there any challenges with that process?Well the only challenge of that process is when two people are editing at the same time and then you have to reconcile. They're not doing it on the same document. 
M92,"So it works best, when one person starts, and they send the document, and then another person makes their edits on top of that person's, and so you end up with a document that, you know.  "
M93,"Or you, typically what I'll do is I'll send it to, there's usually multiple levels of co-authors, for example, and so there's the person who's primarily working on it, and then the next closest person, and so I'll start iteratively going down, and I'll work through most of the bugs, and then I'll send it to this person, and then I'll make, incorporate all of their edits and then I'll send a new clean version to someone else, and then.  "
M94,"So I usually do it that way. But that's only when it's my paper. Other people don't necessarily do it that way, and then it's a little bit harder. But then it's up to them to reconcile it"
M95,". Just because not everybody's, it's not that universal yet. But I think ultimately it would be some sort of portal, I guess where there was kind of unlimited storage, and then you could just all be working off, it could be a place where you would just say, ""Oh, I put this here"" or ""I put that there"", and it would be easier to initiate than, I don't know, I find Dropbox a little bit hard to use; I don't know why. "
M96,"I mean, I do think it would be nice and I know that they kind of exist already, but they're just cumbersome enough that I don't use them a lot. Like things like Dropbox and things like that.  "
M97,"I think, you know, we do a, email is taking collaboration to a whole new level and that is awesome. I don't really know how people did science before we had email.  "
M98,"all of the documents about that project were shared, that would send me notifications with, you know, with something new was done, for example, that could maybe facilitate meetings, you know, maybe there would be a Skype-like aspect to it that could facilitate meetings, via webcam if you were not co-located.  "
M99,"I think if I had a, you know, a five year research project with the same group of people that was a big, collaborative, long-term thing, that having some sort of portal where all the correspondents about that project was captured,.  "
M100,"But, a lot of our projects are shorter duration, and so something more like the Teamwork, where it's more of a project management, works quite well.  "
M101,"And I think maybe a lot of that too is that it's kind of cumbersome to set up, and so it doesn't seem worth it for some of these shorter-term projects. If we had a lot of these, a lot of longer-term projects, and maybe we would.  "
M102,"And within our own group, you know, all of our computers are networked together, so, all of the data and everything is stored on central computers, so any of us can get to it. So we already do that sort of internally. But for external projects, they're never long-term, and so it doesn't seem to make sense. So internally, I guess, we already kind of do that"
M103,"And then we also do, we use TeamViewer a lot, which is a, like a remote desktop connection type of software. So like, and we use that analyze data, but also to control the instruments from remote locations. So it's basically a way you can log in to the, to the computer remotely. "
M104,00:00:16 I have to transcribe all of my interviews. I have to rope in my undergraduate researchers00:00:24 you use dragon or something to do it.  
M105,I’m a collaborator there and um we focus on uh optimizing diagnostic test. That’s one thing we do for infixions diseases um preventative medicine. Epidemiology um yeah. 
M106,"That’s large scale so whether that’s developing tools in the lab to detect disease or that’s taking an existing diagnostic test and amending it or optimizing it so it can detect alternative pathogens in a different setting. Sometimes it’s working it different sample types but ultimately it’s preventing, detecting disease in order to prevent disease. Preventing disease in animals for the most part but they effect humans. "
M107,"what’s the average number of people that I collaborate with per project? Um does this include undergraduates as well, um probably the average number would be 6 to 8.  "
M108,what is your largest00:03:34 definitely be the Paul morel. I don't even know how many people are on that    um and what about you’re smallest.  
M109,00:03:58 smallest would be 3.  
M110,um certainly just expertise. So you are dealing with smaller numbers you don't have as many brains in the pot so you don't have somebody on the team that has experience with um particular area of research that they could weigh in on.  
M111,benefits it’s just easier to communicate. Well often times its somebody that is that I work directly across the hall from or is in the lab with me. So physically it’s easier to communicate because you’re able to walk next door and have a face to face conversation as opposed to having to pick up the phone or have an email. 
M112,often times I feel that it’s maybe a more intimate group collocated.  
M113,Maybe somebody you already worked with so you know what their strengths are and you can depend on them for. What you will have to go outside to get input from somebody else. It’s just easier to know um who they are in general. 
M114,It’s usually smaller groups or people that I’ve you know commonly collaborated with in the past. It’s a good dynamic. The chemistry flows well. 
M115,challenges associated with larger projects is always scheduling.  
M116,Getting people to participate is always difficult dispersed.  
M117,Um I think that it’s also difficult to use the time efficiently. The smaller group it’s easier to use your time efficiently because you’ve go to a smaller group you want to talk or discuss things.  
M118,Larger it’s just um. I think it’s hard to stick to a time line. Everyone haz something they want to share and has input and sometimes you can go on tangents and you’re not sticking to you know you’re not staying focused. A lot of minds coming into it and maybe you’re not I’d say lack of focus could be difficult
M119,um obvious one is you e got a bigger pot of people with experience somebody that’s dealing antimircoribabl resistance stuff and somebody who can run real time par and maybe the two of them can come together and find a way to make that mesh so just having that greater level of experience on the team.  
M120,"you can pick a current research project. How many collaborators are on this project?00:10:08 let’s see, I would say I have to get this straight so. Um 8 I would say there are 8 people. That includes myself"
M121,I’m involved in a lot of the initial how are we going about these techniques in the lab but then also understanding it’s a lot bioinformatics jargon I need to know what we are doing upfront so that we are doing quality data so that it can be used in the bioinformatics.  
M122,They send their graduate students over to get trained I’ll train them on how to do that analysis properly.  
M123,and then in those situations where you’re working with collaborators at other institutions. Why did you chose to work with those collaborators00:15:29 often times when you are seeking funding it strengthens. It gives me that interdisciplinary component. 
M124,other times they’ve got resources that we need. They have a repository of samples that we can use so we establish a collaboration there.  
M125,It’s a combination of strengthening the team to show that we've got people on board for their institutions to show industry and government that can um uh just makes it multi-disciplinary. I think that answers that.  
M126,00:16:15 how do you choose which collaborators that you’re going to work with00:16:18 um often it’s through connections with other people. It’s through networking.  
M127,it can be somebody who has a connection with them and they can put me in contact so I know I have that contact point of contact um.  
M128,Or they just have something that I needs. Something that I can't get somewhere else and so I will go out and introduce myself or find somebody else to introduce me. It’s something that I need that’s going to add value to the work. 
M129,ok um yes certainly form a financial stand point that’s challenging. For people that have to be invaliding budgeting and how that works that can be inititilly a little bit more challenging seating that up.  
M130,so often times if you are working with somebody from used for example from government you go about establishing um subcontracts or it’s a cooperative agreement.  
M131,You have to through eh government policy and the way they go about establishing these cooperative agreements. Which is often different than within the university with in house. Often times there’s conflicts of interest that you have to be an aware of um government people have to get special approval to collaborate. 
M132,I’ve had pretty good luck collaborating with industry people but they are on just a different time standard can be difficult. Sometimes to communicate physically. But um there um looking at the purpose of a project differently than you are. It’s hard to explain
M133,that could be one of the challenges of getting people on the same page of how do we get here. What’s in it for me you know if I’m collaboration why should I give my time over rather than working on something else? I haven't had very many negative really any.  
M134,In my experience sometimes it’s hard because if you’re receiving samples from them or a protocol other sharing the information. The way they would have done it is much different from how you would there might be some disparities there or I might have even an issue or the quality of how it was done.  
M135,I’m sure that vice versa but you get an isolate or a sample and you have to get through and they say yes it is and you look at their method and um theirs flaws and you have to go back and do it differently or you have to take it for what it is and you have to work with what you get.  
M136,Theirs always sensitivity there too because you don't want to imply that the work they do is not high quality.  
M137,And this has come up with working other universities where the quality of work or the way of work is different so trying to mesh those can be complicated. Especially form publication standouts or from funding. You anticipating you’re getting one product. You have to do a whole bunch more manipulation to it to get it to the point you need it at
M138,Oh benefits yeah um just the ease of meeting with people. Setting up meetings. Um understanding how policy works at your university. Um uh how time commitments work and what the understandings are there
M139,Um often times if you’re in the same location or if it’s anybody you know people at cu. I know what Jeff is working on. I know what kinds of projects and time commitments he has ongoing. I know um because I’ve even over in the lab
M140,. I’ve interacts end with the students I know what time commitment I can expect him to be able to donate. Or give. If it’s somebody in the lab I know what they are working on
M141,I would probably say different fields um would say 100 %.  
M142,when you are trying to explain something in laments terms. Sometimes it’s taking something that is complicated and explaining it it’s understandable. That’s difficult. You have to speak in terms of their language
M143,I love learning more about how what I’m doing can be applied in a different way.  
M144,To me I keep getting back to impact that’s really big to me. I do this thing in the lab and I’m using it for x and then I collaborate and I realize I can really utilize your experience in that area. The learning curve is so steep. Always new things
M145,Yeah so we have a thing in the lab where um anytime we are calculating something that is not straight forward. Whether it’s a new solution and it’s you know it’s more complicated than it normally is. We always check our math with somebody else. 
M146,We always say hey lets can we run through this. I want to make sure blinded that you end up with the same answer that I got. It’s a way of double checking that we are doing things accurately. 
M147,it’s easier to do with people in my own lab. Um because they already know what I’m working on or understand why or they are co working with me on it. It’s easier because they are closer they are right her. 
M148,It’s not something I want to take a lot of time with and I want to spend a lot of time explaining to somebody else all the little details about why I’m doing his.  
M149," face to face, yeah because when it comes to doing something like this. Email would be really. It would be more difficult. So just face to face"
M150,I’ve asked for technical expertise on calculating something or figuring something out. And um it’s just easily misunderstood. What my question is if uses. It’s easier to freely talk about it face to face in case there is anything misunderstood
M151,more emails than it needs to be its more of a time commitments as well. Ultimately getting an answer going to the literature and spending some time understanding what this person is getting.  
M152,Email is initially how I contact somebody and then I say if it’s easier to discuss by phone please contact me.  
M153,"if I don't hear back or get the answer that I want, or that’s clear to me then I pick up the phone  and make a phone call and if then I’m not getting an answer over the phone then I’ll set up the time for us to sit down and meet.  "
M154,um in general people are more responsive to emailed. You can be anywhere you can be in a meeting and see it on your phone and respond.  
M155,Whereas email feels faster but if things are too complicated a phone conversation is much easier.  
M156,it feels like you’re um if feels like checkboxes are getting marked off easier. It feels like your actually accomplishing a goal inane even more efficient manor. phonecalls. 
M157,You have somebody right there you have dedicated this time you’re sitting down. And we are going to hash this out right now so to me it feels like there’s a solution. Like it’s finding an answer. 
M158,If it’s somebody that I don't communicate regularly with email is a less intimidating way to go about communicating than a phone call.  
M159,I’m a fairly outgoing person I feel intimidated with a phone call at first. Listening to somebodies voice versus being able to right and edit and if you’re talking and your asked a question or your interacting there’s no so to me it’s just its less formal it’s more informal.  
M160,It allows me to make sure I’m getting my message clearly so it’s clearly received. It just feels you kind of get a kick you get an email back. Ok there’s good chemistry now we can pick up the phone a talk. 
M161,So if I’m the one that is senior author the way I like to go about it is um I pick an order of how I want to send it out. so instead of sending it out all at once and then getting a whole bunch of responses back and then having to merge all of those together I will say I will let the group know hey I have a manuscript.  
M162,"I’m not going to have to get 5 different manuscript edits back then merge all those and decide if I want accept or reject something. It’s easier for me to see one person’s comments, discuss that with them and get that resolved and have an update version and then send that off to the next person.  "
M163,just because it’s more widely used. I mean I would do drop; box but not everybody is familiar with that.  
M164,We did do cloud at one point where everybody was giving different edits. It Gog complicated for a little bit because not everybody was familiar to do it.  
M165,One person would take it off line and work on it and others were working on it online. And then we would have 2 different versions. Somebody has to merge those together. So it’s easier if everybody is familiar with his process sand there’s no unknowns I guess
M166,I never use doodle but that seems to work really well.  
M167,00:43:57 why word00:43:58 um that’s what I’m familiar with. I can't say its more user friendly because I haven't used anything else.  
M168,Somebody else has always set that up. for me personally I’ll go to somebodies outlook and see what their availability is and I’ll schedule and I’ll say here are some proposed times that could work well if its more than one individual.  
M169,"There are sometimes that you just can't figure out a time that’s going to work. I mean technically I’m never going to have a problem with it, no. but trying to get everybody together. That’s an issue"
M170,often times a solution is you pick the best time for  the majority of people and if you can make it you can and if you can't you can't and usually someone takes notes and sends out an update on what occurred.  
M171,I don't know what technology I would call I don’t know what this would classify as. Initially it’s just getting an email. Contacting them and getting a shipping address for example um and then umwelt do I ship so we will do electronically we'll figure out packaging and then physically walk over and have it delivered. 
M172,The university does a iship thing that you can go in and it generates a barcode for you and you can put the address and the zip code and it will automatically say what it’s going to cost what your estimate package dimensions are and dry ice or other biologic or whatever. It’s just an easier way to go about it.  
M173,troubleshooting is easier too face to face.  
M174,its usually sitting down at schedule meetings although in the past we have also written down our own minutes and scheduled by project a couple bullets of where we're at and then we share that with everyone and then somebody will usually take that and compile it into one and it gets saved away in case we need to go back and look at where we are at.  
M175,no it was usually one person is designated to receive the minutes and compile it and they send it out to the group. And always by email. Putting it into word. 
M176,they have been phone conference but usually they are face to face. If it’s within the university it’s always face to face.  
M177,Otherwise it’s what s that. I’ve never had to schedule it but you can schedule a conference the conference calls. I can't think of what that is. 
M178,So you figure out all the time that everyone is going to have a phone conference and you invited and you click on it and you get a personal invitation and code to dial in and you dial that in at 2 o’clock and pick up the phone and there are 7 other people on the phone with you.  
M179,hearing people. Last time I had a hard time hearing with 7 people on the phone. Sometimes sounds like you’re talking down a tunnel and it’s hard to here. 
M180,I don't want interrupt and ask somebody to repeat for me. So um I might miss some stuff and yea.  
M181,it’s more convenient to do a teleconference.  
M182,Skype would be my last option then I’d rather do a phone conference and email. If it’s an initially interaction email being preferred method first.  
M183,Um sort of this out of site out of mind. You get going on something and sometimes your realize you haven't really communicated with swum in a while.  
M184,it would be pretty cool where you had the technology like linked in were you can be connected with these different people and you can see what here expertise are and what they know about but you could also know who they know.  
M185,During my dissertation I wanted to know about but I had no experience doing this particular part of research. I could type that in in a search box but I can also look more globally but I can look more convenient I just want to look with in cu maybe I want to include cu and cu Denver.  
M186,I can type in a search and it would give me like dropdown box. What do you want to know about this? Are you doing this inside live culture? Are you doing this Indies live animals. And you oil take that and from that search you would be able to connect to somebody that has that level of experience and is willing. 
M187,"I would say roughly in terms of involvement at the level of like who is going to be on the paper when it is published and that level, probably in the vicinity of 4 to 5 is the number of average authors on a paper that I publish.  "
M188,Sometimes there’s a larger number of physical bodies that contributed to the project in some way because there might be a technician who is involved but did not have quite as much involvement that they should be published. In some cases you might expand that number to more of like the 8 to 10 range.  
M189,Usually most of my work involves a combination of working with organisms collected from natural populations. I do a lot of work with like classic model systems.  
M190,I can only think of one main project where I generated a lot of the sequence data and was an author on a paper but someone else was the lead author on that and they drove a lot of the analysis of the project.  
M191,"How many, percentage wise, have involved at least one collaborator at another institution? SarahA pretty good fraction. More than 50%.  "
M192,I have got a whole slew of publications for example that were all built around sequencing mitochondrial genomes that came out of my dissertation work as a graduate student at university of Virginia and that's something that was not something people did in the lab I was trained in or nor did anyone at the university.  
M193,", I already had a little bit of a collaboration going with someone because she asked me to send them seeds and stuff like that and she was working on that technique.  "
M194,"Yup. And it’s gone above that I'm not sure if I have ever been an author on something, you know, sent them seeds. But I have definitely had people on papers who have provided materials to me, and that was their role in collaboration. "
M195,"In that case it wasn't a co-call, they actually came to the University of Virginia to give a seminar. I was meeting with them and discussing what I was working on and the project and the problems I was looking into and they made the offer and hey you know, if you would like to come out to the lab, we would host you.  "
M196,". I emailed them three times afterwards and they didn't respond for a while, I pestered them enough and then they followed through with the offer.  "
M197,So the reason this name sort of came while I was at a conference recently I was discussing it with a colleague there and he basically said you should talk to him and him and one of them some who I know from literature you know.  
M198,"Also their personalities, they are really nice people and open type things. That is also something you don't get from the literature either.  "
M199,"I think it definitely matters quite a bit, whether or not you initiate a collaboration but then also whether or not you take it, there are sometimes where you have a collaboration and say sure that will work, but not necessarily want to repeat or pursue indefinitely.  "
M200,". Then there are other ones where you say this is great, you have a skill, we have a skill they work well together and we can get a lot more productivity out of this.  "
M201,"I think their some where their isn't a natural connection or next step where the synergy still will exist and it’s like okay, we came together and got something done.  "
M202,"Very commonly, theirs a relationship that is already.  "
M203,"Certainly one of the biggest ones is engagement. Getting them to provide, put their role into the project on the time frame that you want distributed.  "
M204,Sometimes someone is like yeah I can do that for you and then you send them the necessary materials or whatever and months go by and it just hasn't happened and you know they have other stuff going on.  
M205,You can’t set the time table and the priorities if someone else is doing a key piece of the project.  
M206,"It depends on the specific project, but nothing more than gentle prodding with email, like what’s going on. getting people to work together.  "
M207,. And then there are like the bypass route and that come in more in publications and in writing phase because you have the same problem where you write something up and you send it to your collaborators to comment or provide feedback on.  
M208,So some collaborators are less responsive in terms of like getting comments back on a manuscript that you want to submit.  
M209,"Sometimes I got to the opt-out model where I send them A manuscript and instead of being like okay let me know what your comments are and feedback I will send the manuscript and say I am going to submit this on Friday unless I hear something other from you or have other input. Instead of them sign off on something and actively do them, I make them actively stop the process type of thing.  "
M210,"If it is like an essential step in the project, then you either have to figure out a way to do it or just wait. I don't think of a lot of examples where I have dropped somebody or went to someone else or done it myself, at least not the big things.  "
M211,Basically expand the scope of the science you can do. People have limited techniques.  
M212,"I have limited abilities, there are something I know how to do and a bunch of things I font. A lot of the collaborations have addressed scientific questions that I would have otherwise not have been able to do with my skill set. That's the big one. "
M213,Certainly easier in terms of coordination. The only drawback I could see is that you are drawing from a more limited pool of expertise.  
M214,You are not necessarily going to the best people in the world who know how to do it. You are going to the best local expert.  
M215,If something is confusing or weird or you need special instructions you can walk down the hall and talk to people.  
M216,So a good example of this is I feel like is genomic facilities. So more and more the actual DNA sequencing that gets done is centralized at major genomic facilities where samples get sent in and they do the preparation and things like that.  
M217,A pretty limited list I did this one thing where I had a very small part on it. But with Christina lab group in computer science. But even that they are bioinformaticsmatition. 
M218,"There have been some economic projects, there was a paper I published last year where there was a bigger genomic project.  "
M219,in that second one that I mentioned where there was a larger genome facility with two computer scientists. I never directly interacted with them.  
M220,In fact I didn't even know their name until I put their name on the paper at the end.  
M221,"It was more of that leader in the group, the PI in that group, that was the go between.  "
M222,"We speak the same language, which is an advantage. It tends to be where were communicate fairly easily. There were too many where I really felt where I was so ignorant to what they were working on that I couldn't understand. all biologists"
M223,The communication is easier. The disadvantage I guess would be the mirror statement of what I said what the advantage of collaboration was to begin with where it expands the scientific questions you can ask.  
M224,"Because I'm working in a more limited domain of biology, that also limits the scientific questions that I'm addressing where they require breaking new boundaries in statistic, computer science, or physics. We wouldn't have the ability to do that with the current collaborators.  "
M225,"Certainly writing, writing a paper that results from all of this research is a big one multi researcher task.  "
M226,"Oh yeah, the ever painful exchanges with word MS.  "
M227,Not too much emailing drafts of papers back and forth. You know you write this section and I will integrate it. Usually whoever is the driver is the integrator. 
M228,"So as people send them in, she puts them in. So if she sends something to me and I tear it up with track changes and she incorporates them into her copy.  "
M229,Mostly they are paralyzed interactions going back and forth with individuals.  
M230,"With this particular group of individuals, there are a couple of times where I am like okay we just need to get together. Out of all of these people I just listed there are two graduate rotation students and one post doc who just got together here in a room here on campus.  "
M231,"Usually when the topic is complicated enough I would say involves multiple people, and it involves multiple back and forth, right? It’s not just question, answer. It’s like question, and what is the answer to that. So we need to make some decisions. "
M232,You are matching the email thread in your head and it’s just going to be way too complicated.  
M233,"Usually it is by email, that's the main thing and just CCing multiple people and you know, conversations going back and forth and sometimes getting unwieldy.  "
M234,You get multiple emails coming back at the same time and didn’t read it because they were writing it at the same time.  
M235,"Too much information on similar topics coming in at once with people responding to one question, but forgetting to respond to the other part. email.  "
M236,"if that is me, I usually, if there are things I think are important I try to follow up and say okay this was missed or you guys are saying two different things.  "
M237,. If I am not the one in charge and I don’t think it’s that important I ignore it. If I do think it’s important I try to be the thorn in people’s side and say hey I think this is important. 
M238,For that we did weekly conference calls. Which were not set up by me. I just got the AT&T access code and called in at 9 in the morning where I called in. those were like 30 people on the conference call
M239,"It was fine, there were little bits that were sometimes important to me that I had to share but I would usually sit there with my phone on mute, doing something else waiting for my ears to perk up for something that was like what’s going on with this.  "
M240,"So it was probably a fair amount of wasted of time. The fraction of the call that was important to the average individual, the call was quite small.  "
M241,"Were there any benefits to doing a large discussion? -SarahYeah, there were, people would chime and know things and there were some redundancy that was avoided and stuff like that.  "
M242,"Not just on your one inset species, at the time I thought that sounded pretty cool and there was another researcher who was on it and they were there on the phone and perked up and was like we are interested in that too.  "
M243,"It’s kind of a hodgepodge. Just sharing the data is like you know, depends on the data set right.  "
M244,"Some, when I say a hodgepodge of stuff it depends on file size. So email, if it’s small enough it’s an excel spread sheet and I you know, just send it out CC a bunch of people.  "
M245,"When it gets a little bigger you know, but it’s small enough to fit in drop box that is definitely a common one that I use. If it gets a little bigger I have like free drop box with a five gig limit, so i quickly run out.  "
M246,I can't share everthing on dropbox you know. so thats a little bit bigger than that but not too unwilldy.  
M247,"CSU has Pangea at least the natural sciences, a quick way of dropping on to a website.  "
M248,"I just posted, its equivalent of posting it on a website, so yes, using that context there is a public html website and I can set up a folder for Justin and you can download things here.  "
M249,So that I use for some stuff and things get really big then it like just set up a monnar server and let them sshn. And people do the reverse.  
M250,"It works fine with my server because there is no, it’s not behind anything that restricts. You don’t have vpn. If you got the ip address for my server you can access it from anywhere in the world. So probably not the best for security"
M251,"We just did the reverse, where I needed to  exchange a lot of data and a lot of it was on a server, they set up an account for me on that server and for that I did needed to like ssnp or sscp I needed the port flag or something like that with a specific number.  "
M252,"If I were on campus I would not have had to do that, but because that was the pathway and if you were not on campus you did not have a vpn setup for that university.  "
M253,For me the thing I can don most quickly is zip off an email.  
M254,I send like 200 emails a day.  
M255,"I don’t use drop box a ton, I find that window if it fits in drop box is someone what narrow, but that seems like an easy tool for me I have got the plug in on my machine.  "
M256,I have a little folder and I stick it in that folder automatically and then I click the share link and it goes. So that is pretty easy.  
M257,Pangea is pretty easy but I just dont think of that very often. Sometimes I forget the name of the program.  
M258,"I'm remembering it now but I'm like Pangea, what’s that thing called and them I’m searching for it on my computer.  "
M259,And sharing the things over the server is a pain in the ass.  
M260,recently that example in Virginia they set up the account for me but the person their wasn’t a real sis-administrator and they were just a researchers and they like set up the count but they did not set up a default home directory so at that point I was writing stud to them There was not write privileges for me. So then I had to email those saying they had to set up write privileges   But people are used to different things. They try to connect to the server and it doesn’t work so they send back a question saying how do I do this or where am I going and that type of stuff. 
M261,There was not write privileges for me. So then I had to email those saying they had to set up write privileges.  
M262,But people are used to different things. They try to connect to the server and it doesn’t work so they send back a question saying how do I do this or where am I going and that type of stuff.  
M263,so you know sharing stuff over the serve depends on someone knowing what they are doing in a command lab environment right.  
M264,"And this is certainly like in the context of the lab and stuff like that. Theirs like under grades who know you know, don’t have any experience in that in which case it is much easier for me to you know to stick the file even if it’s too large email, stick the files on the website and send them a link to that to download here.  "
M265,because they have infinite experience with web browsers and stuff then to teach them how to sap or she so certainly theirs that level to where if it’s going to go up top retrieving things from the server they are just some people who just don’t have that skill set. So I go other routes. So that would be the one main example that I can think of. 
M266,. My notebook is usually a word file or something like that where I am just pasting what I did in and command lines.  
M267,"I tend to keep it that simple. but one of my grade students who started used one note or something like that, a Microsoft product, but that is how she kept her notebook and you know when we were going through analysis like that she kept her notebook in that format so she could send it to me so I could give her feedback on the analysis that she used.  "
M268,There are some that is a little more complicated where you are smuggling across international boundaries. Not literal smuggling.  
M269,The place where I feel like I waste a lot of time and is inefficient in collaboration is in the writing.  
M270,"track changes exists but, I don't know I almost always find that I end up manually incorporating the edits that people send me but their computer corrupts my note stuff that is inserted into it or I have been working on it too so therefore my version is not the same as theirs because of the time delay,.  "
M271,something that allows more efficient simultaneous contribution to the writing of papers because I really feel like I spend a lot of time manually going through comments and taking the ones I want and sticking them into my document.  
M272,. So something that better allows for simultaneous editing. and then there is also collaborating with the more computational people and they send me latex file and I have no idea how the hell to do that and I’m sure there is some type of track changes for that but I do not know what that is for me. 
M273,The sharing of large data sets is another one that is frequently a pain and that is probably more about money maybe than lack of tools.  
M274,"Sharing big data sets, there is club resources where you can buy and give access to everybody, for some reason I am resistant to that.  "
M275,I’m like alright I’m not going to pay for more drop box storage and I’m not going to buy alumina where you just store data on the cloud.  
M276,"it’s just that I haven’t done the calculations to think about it, I just have this natural reaction where I don’t want to pay for cloud storage space.  "
M277,I don’t want to pay apple for iCloud space.  
M278,Determining the tipping point is not an easy one. But I would certainly be willing to pay something where I felt there was an integrated long term solution.  
M279,Whereas I’m like okay this is where you storage solution is and I feel confident that it is doing to be back up that is one thing I worry about all the time. Storing in different placed and different building if there was a way where it was out there that would not let me worry about that crap I would certainly be one to pay for it.  
M280,"What is the average number of collaborators on the projects you have worked on? (including self)P3: It ranges from like 3, 4, to uh 50.  "
M281,"Then, there's when you get the grant typically we collect samples so there's people who are involved in coordinating sample collection and you know calling all of the places that you are getting samples, travelling there, and then getting the samples and everything.  "
M282,"We are doing alot of sequencing now, so we have a group that is doing the sequencing of the samples.  "
M283,": And I write papers, and I do grant, I help with the grant part of it. I haven't done any of the sample processing or lab work. I understand it because I have to coordinate it and I haven't done much sample collection. "
M284,"Sarah: Yeah, that USDA one. P3: Oh my gosh.  That's up at like 58"
M285,"The benefit is, if there is sample collection involved, for example processing, you just can't do a project like that with a small number of people.  "
M286,"I mean for one, for one sampling effort for one of those projects, we had to send 5 people to Florida because the way the industry works they didn't want one person going from barn A to B to C to D to E.  "
M287,"And we just needed so many different areas of expertise to get the project done, you need people with expertise in all different things, and if you bring people on board who you work well with and are nice people, it is really fun to work on a big project like that.  "
M288,Obviously you get subgroups from the larger group and it's it's kinda cool to work with the different subgroups and then come together as a large group and then break off.  
M289,". I mean the downside is just coordinating everything you know? It's a massive undertaking to make sure all of the different pieces are happening when they should and everyone is making progress. And then, one group might have a problem, and it's like how do we solve it, and how does that problem affect all of the other things that are happening?. "
M290,And so it's just really logistically a challenge. And it's hard keeping everyone up to date on everything all the time.  
M291,"We have a weekly meeting right? But, probably a dozen people are there on average.  "
M292,So there are people on the project who haven't really heard about what's going on in the project since our initial meeting which was like 8 months ago.  
M293,"And then we had, the only comprehensive meeting we've had so far was back in February, where we had everyone on the grant was on the call. So there's people in the room and we also called people in.  "
M294,"Well, it's just more manageable. Like, you know, with four people I just send an email, you know what I mean? It's way easier to keep everyone in the loop because there's only four people.  "
M295,"The nice thing I guess, this has never happened to me, I can see in a large group there's more chances for, well, if maybe certain people aren't as great to work with, there's always other people, you know what I mean? large groups.  "
M296,"In the group where as if in a small group like if you get stuck with someone who's not so great, then you don't really have alternatives. But I could see if that could be a problem.  "
M297,What percentage of your projects have involved at least one collaborator at another institution? (8:45)P3: 100%.  
M298,Some of the projects we were brought on as collaborators by those institutions. So they asked us to collaborate with them.  
M299,"Typically, then we call people we know and ask if they know anybody. It would be second hand.  "
M300,They'll call us and say can you help us? And we want to help people and want to collaborate as long as their nice and they're not going to screw us over.  
M301,"We do that not because we need to but, because it's always nice to have collaboration.  "
M302,"I just think you know that some of the collaborators I've never even met them in person so that's a little bit difficult cause you know, I just don't even know what they look like, I don't know, it's a little bit harder.  "
M303,"But in general I don't find that it's too bad, the hard part is when you need to talk to alot of people at once.  "
M304,"That's the hard part. For instance, right now, I'm working on a graphic for a paper and I don't do graphics really, so I call this guy who does really great powerpoints, his graphics are really pretty, he's like sure I can totally make that happen.  "
M305,"So working with him, I just call him on the phone I don't need to schedule a meeting. We just talk on the phone.  "
M306,"But, if it involves like more than a few people than you know it's just hard to manage a phone call, who's going to talk next, people tend to talk at the same time.  "
M307,"You just don't get that sort of connection. So I just gave two webinars last week and both of them had like 40 people on the call maybe and so I gave the webinar, but they were all muted so you don't get feedback.  "
M308,"I'm just talking into the phone and I have no idea if people are following this, do they have questions, you know. And at the end there are questions but it is hard to have 40 people ask questions on the phone.  "
M309,"I use Skype when it's again, one or two people.  "
M310,"And that seems to work pretty well. And then like I've used for my PhD defense we used BlueJeans which is a video teleconferencing whatever system. And it works okay, except like everytime we have to use it we have to call the IT department, have them set up a line, test out the system, there's always kinks even though the five same people used it for my PhD. "
M311,"Well, I think you get access to different expertise. That's why we have them on board right.  "
M312,"? If we just restricted to ourselves what's here, we wouldn't be able to do alot of these projects. So that's one thing. I do think that you get a little bit different perspective on the project by working with a different group. "
M313,I think that as a student and someone who is going to be looking for a job. It's good because you have more connections right?.  
M314,all the projects we are working on have a bioinformatics component and we are working with computer scientists and everything. So I would say all of them.  
M315,"Yeah, those were more working with vetinary, within the vetinary field with epidemiologists, microbiologists, statisicans. Well, epidemiologist's do a lot of statistics. Industry, like ag industry. "
M316,"Different fields have different ways of doing things. So even like questions of authorship, that's handled differently in different fields. Who's listed as a co-author?. "
M317,". I don't really think a lot of it is so much differences between the science fields, it's more differences between how different groups work you know? I don't really see a lot of downside there.  "
M318,"I mean, I think it's worked really well because we have people in our group who can describe like if the computer science people are doing something really hardcore computer science, they can still translate that at a high level for us to, so that we understand what we need to understand even though if we don't get all of the details.  "
M319,"From our side, we can describe to the computer scientist okay this is what we're doing and how does that fit in to what we need form you and what you're doing. We've been pretty good at sort of translating that back and forth, but I can see if you're, that might not always happen as well.  "
M320,So it maybe becomes hard to connect the work that one group is doing to the work that another group is doing and making sure that you're going towards the common goal. It's so far working really well for us.  
M321,"Well, to me the con is that it is not just as interesting because everyone comes from the same background and like everyone sort of works on the same stuff to an extent.  "
M322,I guess there is more competition in a way because you are working in the same field and you are doing the same stuff.  
M323,"There is more potential for territorial actions versus when you are working with people totally outside, they have their own funding sources and stuff they do and you have your own and you come together to work on common things.  "
M324,"Writing grants, organizing sample collection, organizing project execution, organizing communication within the group, organizing the sample processing. That could be done by one person I guess. Although we typically involve multiple people in that. "
M325,"Doing the analysis. Often if it is an analysis that's simple I'll do it myself, but if it is an analysis that has any problems or we haven't done it before, or I'm coming across with issues with it, I'll involve multiple people. Writing the paper starts out as a single person but then once you get to a certain point you send it out for co-author comments and reviews, so that becomes a group project. "
M326,"Even things like going to conferences, we typically do that with other people in the group. I've gone to maybe one conference by myself and every other conference is with other people.  "
M327,Our data is typically on a server and everyone has access to it.  
M328,"If there, if I do an analysis in excel and someone elese needs to see it. I'll email them the analysis or if I write a script or some code or something and then someone needs it, I'll just email it to them.  "
M329,The server's more big stuff that we can't email. And things that people use repetively and it's common.  
M330,". Then, stuff by email would be smaller data sets that maybe not as many people are using. Also, outputs of analyses that I did, that I'm sharing. "
M331,"Well, alot of people don't know how to get onto the server.  "
M332,"Or they don't have a user id or whatever and honestly it's just habit. I've always used email, but I haven't used the server until the couple years.  "
M333,"Well, sometimes with the server, so the structure of the different directories and all that changes sometimes. So then the data gets moved. That can be a problem. "
M334,". If data gets moved you tell someone okay the data is located at this path and then they goto look there and it's not there. So then you say I don't know where it is and you have to find it. And then emails not too hard except emails fine, you just can't send large files, so yeah"
M335,"We put data on there anyone can access it, but typically we have so few users, people who know how to use the server that it just ends up being a few people who access it.  "
M336,And the other problem with the server is that we can't get access for people who aren't at CSU or who aren't affiliated with CSU.  
M337,"We do have someone who does want to get access to the server who's not faculty, she's a post-doc and she's in Canda and she has no, I don't know if were going to be able to. So we've been mailing hard drives to each other.  "
M338,When you're working on writing grants coming up with grants ect.  What tools do you use to accomplish this task? (27:48)P3: Word. And Excel for the budget
M339,Why specifically Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel? (28:18)P3: Cause I have them on my computer and everyone I work with uses them.  
M340,"Actually, I just wrote a grant, actually I didn't write a grant, I, Christina Boucher wrote a grant and she uses LaTeX. I actually installed LaTeX on my computer and I used it.  "
M341,LaTeX Works?.  
M342,"I didn't compile anything. So, she had the different parts and I just downloaded the. tex files and changed them, and then put them on back to dropbox. "
M343,So she shared dropbox with me. And so I just let her know when I was done editing all the different sections and she compiled it.  
M344,"Email, or text, or phone. One of the three. We were on the phone, but I actually texted her when I was done. "
M345,"She compiled it, and then she also had the bibliography. That opened up automatically in bibtex maybe. Then I went in and added a few and then I did the slash curly bracket cite whatever. I didn't know if it worked, but she didn't say anything"
M346,"It was fine. I didn't, I don't have the knowledge yet. I just haven't, I'm not familiar with how to make it bold or italiczed. If I were actually putting a grant together and I needed to do all that formatting I think it would be really hard, but I was just editing words and adding a couple of citations Latex"
M347,"Well, I like using the dropbox. That's nice. And I do use DropBox with some of the other grad students. Sharing just word files and excel files"
M348,Why do you use DropBox with just grad students? (31:25)P3: Because they use it. And the faculty don't.  
M349,"And one of them setup a DropBox project folder for it. And I don't usually do that because it's just laziness. It's just upfront time setting it up, setting out the invitations, blah blah blah. I just email it"
M350,"Actually, I shared it with like ten people, but only two people have accepted is Ztero for references.  "
M351,They don't have it installed. I'm sure. And there's a bit of a learning curve with it. So I don't even think they've installed it yet
M352,"If it's gonna be, if I feel like it's gonna be a long conversation about lots of back and forth. I'll just call. Versus like, this is what you need to do. Then, I'll do an email cause it's just easier"
M353,"It's just more time consuming. And then it can drag out over days, whereas if I just call them I can get the conversation done within, with one conversation versus back and forth and then they don't get to the email or I don't get to the email and then it's just a longer process.  "
M354,"So if I need to reach a group of people, then I'll send out an email. Versus if I know if it's one person I need to talk to, I'll just call them.  "
M355,": I don't know how to do a conference call. I know that through the university you can call and setup a time to use the conferencing system, but then I have to be on a csu phone in a certain location and half the time I do these calls I'm driving my car or you know.  "
M356,"Well, for alot of analysis we use the server or excel. But typically if were talking about it we'll do it in person.  "
M357,. To do the analysis. But if were talking about analysis it's typically in person or over the phone. 
M358,"Yeah, I've used.  Skype. I just don't"
M359,Usually with email or like that one project because we have a dropbox folder for it. Then I'll use the dropbox. I'm pretty bad though. I always forget to update the dropbox
M360,"Yeah, to edit it or review it. Yeah. And then they do that with the track changes and  then. "
M361,So they'll use track changes to you know or comments. And then I get all of those and just try to integrate them.  
M362,"Yeah, it's a pain in the ass. So.  I usually"
M363,"Sometimes what I'll do is like if I have multiple comments from like for four people where they write the comments in Word I'll compile them into one document, I'll cut and paste each of the comments and I'll put them in so they seem all together.  "
M364,"And then some of the comments, especially as a PhD student I didn't feel comfortable addressing them. I wanted to make sure I was addressing them correctly. I'd have to schedule a meeting with my advisor. It can defintely take a few weeks to go through that process"
M365,"So we'll meet, we'll talk separately, as a subgroup and then have a big meeting. Often afterwards grad students will stay or stcik around and then talk amongst ourselves, and then talk about problems, talk about where we are, and then put together a plan for what we're going to work on next.  "
M366,So that's sort of done in person and then I feel like if we haven't had one of those in person meetings for awhile and people have problems then they'll email the group.  
M367,"And then for phone calls if I have a problem and I'm like okay I need to ask Christina about it, I'll just call her. But, often, often that's not the most efficient way because I'll talk to someone on the phone, but that information does not get dissemited to other people in the group so I have to remember to relay what we talked about to other people and thayt happens alot.  "
M368,"Oh, yeah we had  a conversation. Sorry we didn't tell you about that. You just can't keep track of all of it. "
M369,"And so the people who are in charge, they don't have time to take minutes to keep track of who's working on what, to send out emails to the group and getting everyone up to date.  "
M370,We wanted to have a website for our group be an internal facing thing too. Where we can put updates up there so everyone knows what's going on. But that hasn't happened because everybody's busy. 
M371,"We just hired an admin. So she's like hopefully, hopefully she's going to do alot of that. Just sort of organizing the group and yeah, we'll see how it goes. I don't envy her job"
M372,": Something that just kep track of all of the different things that are happening. Like, that kept track of okay Noelle and Christina had a meeting at this time and they talked about this, and this is what resulted from that, and that everyone could see that.  "
M373,"Something that just centralized all of that so that it's almost like a log file of what has happened, what tasks grew out of that, who's working on them. That would be.  "
M374,In a sentence or two I would say the overall goal is to see how genes get turned on and off in development and in response to stimuli.  
M375,What is the average number of collaborators on the projects you have worked on? (including self)That’s a good question I would say 8 but let me just pull out the publication list and see if that is accurate yeah I would say 8 is accurate.  
M376,I think your largest was about 11 coauthors?  That sounds about right.  
M377,I mean one obvious disadvantage is you have less intellectual input from fewer sources small groups.  
M378,one of the advantages of having a big  group working on a project  is you have a lot of input from people who might be approaching the problem from a slightly different mind set so you might have some novel insight to the project.  
M379,you have people to bounce ideas off of so that that can be sort of an limitation and you also have less people that can double check your work pick up mistakes you made.  
M380,The biggest disadvantage is that with fewer authors you have fewer people doing the work so projects take longer typically at least doing the experiments takes longer.  
M381,the actual data analysis and management together can be a lot faster with fewer authors because you are not dependent on multiple people getting their data together.  
M382,having multiple people who have to write the manuscript so the more people you have involved in generating figures and writing text the longer things take.  
M383,So and of course that’s not always true sometimes if you have a really efficient group of people you have 10 authors on a paper and everybody’s contributing a fair amount and they are doing so in a really efficient manner and it actually makes things go faster.  
M384,Well one of the biggest difficulties is having collaborators who are really busy and they have multiple projects going on and your collaborative project may not be their highest priority or even if it is their highest priority they still have to split their effort amongst multiple projects.  
M385,most situations there is a lead author or two or three lead authors and these are the people who are directly responsible for directing the project or at least responsible for directing the experiments for the project and making sure that things move forward at a reasonable pac.  
M386,you have the corresponding author who is the last person listed on the project or the last two people on the project and these are the people whose lab is typically being done in when we are talking about microbiology research these are the people who are ultimately directing the project.  
M387,more difficult sorts of people to collaborate with people you are reliant on for computational stuff this doesn’t tend to be a big problem for us because we do most of our computations ourselves but for other labs especially I have been in this situation myself you are depending on a computational biologist to do some data analysis for you that can be a huge limiting step.  
M388,I mean every situation was sort of unique in some cases the collaborators had expertise in computational methods that we lacked in other cases they had data related our project and we decided to pool their data in with ours because their data couldn’t really stand alone as a project.  
M389,this most recent paper it was simply because the project started when we were at the same institution and we all moved to different institutions.  
M390,"Primarily because they were people we knew well, friends, I would say that’s one of the most common ways.  "
M391,if there is specific expertise you are interested in there is convenience as a factor of course there is how well you know those people and of course there is their expertise specifically6 as it relates to your projects or questions in most of these cases it was a combination of those three things.  
M392,The other thing I failed to mention in the question why you collaborate with specific people in some cases when I have collaborated with other groups I wasn’t really central to their project in some instances there were contributing reagants and stuff that hadn’t necessarily been published yet.  
M393,it’s really just the same things convenience people we were friends with maybe their contribution wasn’t essential to the paper but would prove the paper maybe at the same time it was mutually beneficial for both groups and because we were friends with that group.  
M394,Obviously the advantage is you can talk to people in person and that’s always advantageous especially when you can have lab meetings together.  
M395,you can sit and present your data in a group that’s collaborating on a project I feel like that’s the most effective way of collaborating but of course that becomes difficult when you start working with people outside your institution.  
M396,not having the advantages of having people from different institutions that will have different resources and stuff that they can bring to the table.  
M397,So speaking in person I think is typically more effective because it tends to be more casual so it’s not as forced or scheduled.  
M398,so when you are speaking in person you might I have a tendency to think more casually and take my time I am more likely to come up with ideas or have insight.  
M399,if you are talking to somebody over the phone or over skype it’s just that environment where its more fixed like you have a fixed amount of time you are going to be in this meeting for an hour you have a more specific role to play.  
M400,it doesn’t give you as much freedom to think or come up with ideas I don’t think that is always true today with really nice interactive chat skype chat type situations.  
M401,you can sort of recreate that physical interaction you can have with people at the same institution if I have to choose between skyping or the phone I will choose the phone rather than skype I just prefer to talk to people over the phone.  
M402,compared to skype you are going to be more self-conscious when you can see their face on a computer screen and image quality is never that great and there tend to be little disruptions and stuff due to the technology not being perfect.  
M403,on the phone it’s just more casual you can do whatever you want and nobody can see what you are doing you can be spilling your coffee it just doesn’t matter I feel it can be just more casual typically.  
M404,Right so I can’t really think of any collaborations with anyone who is in a nonbiology field.  
M405,so the collaborations are usually we do molecular biology so occasionally we will have a collaboration with somebody whose focus is more cell biology or computational biology and I definitely work with computer scientists who are not biologists so that is  probably the closest thing but even those computer scientists who are not biologists by training people I have collaborated with still have a little bit of biological understanding not much but.  
M406,Yeah exactly  we do a lot of computational work ourselves so even though it’s not the same field there’s a lot of overlap between what we do and those bioinformatician type of people we collaborate with.  
M407,There’s always sort of a language barrier whenever you are talking about biology or something else be it computer science or physics or wherever else even though all those disciplines can be interconnected.  
M408,there still can be a language barrier when you are communicating in terms of biology or comp science or whatever whenever people are trained in different disciplines.  
M409,collaborating with biometricians they understand basic biology but they are not going to understand little nuances say you are working with nucleic acids they don’t understand the difference between DNA and RNA.  
M410,there are little things like this they might not think of so you go to do your data analysis and they are not taking some of the finer details into consideration when they do that analysis simply because they don’t think in terms of biology as much as say writing code or whatever.  
M411,Definitely people who are trained in computer science are almost going to have a much higher level of computational expertise and knowledge of how to write programs.  
M412,what can be accomplished as a biologist who knows a little scripting or whatnot for me it’s going to be more difficult to gauge how feasible time wise and processor and memory wise to do some application whereas somebody who is trained as a computer scientist is gonna have a much better grasp of it.  
M413,It’s always nice to have intellectual input from people who come from a different discipline because they are probably going to be thinking about things  just a little bit differently.  
M414,I guess the advantage is we are all speaking the same language so it is easy to understand what everybody is doing and for everybody to understand what’s going on when you bring in people from other disciplines who don’t necessarily understand the project.  
M415,We’ve definitely had projects that never took off because the collaborators were sort of spearheading them and their priorities changed.  
M416,In the examples I can think of we never invested so much into them that we were like really that disappointed that they didn’t take off.  
M417,it was usually things that were in early stages or we had anticipated that our two projects would intersect at some point and they never intersected so we just continued our separate paths.  
M418,Major tasks are initially sort of agreeing what the individual contributions will be that is something you are constantly revisiting throughout a project because projects will sometimes take one or two years to complete.  
M419,the task of writing the manuscript of course the task of reading the manuscript reading the manuscript ideally all the authors reading the manuscript checking for errors making their contributions to the manuscript and that’s usually a back and forth thing because usually manuscript go through multiple iterations.  
M420,"That you know, that you haven’t published some results that would really benefit somebody else. Yeah it’s really common to share that with people.  "
M421,"There needs to be this sort of understanding that, you know they are not going to take something that you shared with them in confidentiality and go spread it around to people who might be in competition with you.  "
M422,"But yeah, I think that and you know, I think we should all be encouraging the sharing of unpublished data and so definitely a proponent.  "
M423,"But none the less, I mean within a group and every collaborative group I have been in we share. We don’t withhold anything from anybody.  "
M424,You can’t really withhold data from your group because that can lead to all sorts of problems.  
M425,"emails of course, is the biggest.  "
M426,"Things like drop box or google drive where you are just storing, sharing, editing files, I would say those two are the biggest because most of everything is, we do electronically now.  "
M427,"Sure we talk on the phone occasionally or skype or whatever else. But as far as like how the sharing or the coordinating else does, it’s mostly via email and drop box file sharing.  "
M428,"00:38:29 so when would you use email versus skype or phone or in person to communicate? -Sarah00:38:45 I think when you need to, if you expect very little back and forth. like this is, you know, share some information with somebody or just get some questions answered or answer some questions or whatever and you don’t expect a lot of back and forth, and it doesn’t need done.  "
M429,"Or is there is a lot of back and forth that can be spread out over days and days and days, emails are just easier because it is at your own convenience.  "
M430,"But when you need to sort of brain storm or think through things where there is going to be a lot of back and forth you need to come a conclusion in a short amount of time, that’s when skype and the phone are really useful.  "
M431,"Also when you just want to get or you just sort of want to get the group together to make sure everybody is on the same page and stuff, skype can be a lot better for that because with emails everybody a little bit disconnected.  "
M432,I feel like when you have skype it is easier to get everybody sort of on the same page.  
M433,so skype is really useful when there are more than two people involved.  
M434,". So if it’s you and more than one other person, I feel like skype is easier.  "
M435,It’s much harder to have a three way conversation so I think two way conversations are easier over the phone.  
M436,"But three way conversations I feel like become much easier over skype because you can see who is talking, it’s easier to sort of go back and forth. And it’s a little more engaging.  "
M437,"yeah, usually the only reason we do that is if it’s because it really convenient. Like we are going to be at the same meeting or that person is going to be in the area and they might as well stop by the lab and we can chat.  "
M438,Or we need to go to that persons institution to do some experiment in there lab or they need to come to our lab to do an experiment or whatever. Some mostly it is a convenience thing because it is never a essential anymore.  
M439,Like people who were like my post doc colleagues and stuff or maybe like my PhD advisor or something. I would be more inclined to just call them up or just send them an email saying give me a call when you get a chance and talk to them over the phone.  
M440,People that I'm not as well acquainted with I am more likely to do email.  
M441,email is a little more formal.  
M442,It is easy to email somebody you hardly know at all. It happens all the time we email people we hardly know.  
M443,"We are a lot less likely to call people we hardly know, right and be like hey this is so and so from so and so.  "
M444,"I feel like in that case but maybe you need to talk to her, because that person you never met, sometimes it’s just easier to just send them an email.  "
M445,somebody will shoot me an email and say can I talk to you on the phone or something.  
M446,if you send me all of these questions I can spend a lot of time thinking about them and come up with really nice answers.  
M447,"I’m on the spot so I just have to come up with whatever you know, comes to mind.  "
M448,"so actually since I started my lab, whenever we start a new project, this is something I sort of initiated back in my post doc lab that whenever we start a project, we make a drop box folder.  "
M449,"And figures, the manuscript, and some data related to that project just go into that drop box folder so anybody working on that project can go into that folder and you know, look at the current status of the manuscript or the data, the figures or whatever.  "
M450, there is the challenge of if you have multiple people going into this folder you run the risk of people overriding your files.  
M451,"you know they go in to change a figure or something and then they don’t save it as a new copy or whatever and then you do not like the changes they made, but you can't go change it back easily because that version of the file easily.  "
M452,00:45:50 they do have a version control system control on drop box -Sarah00:45:56 they do? -P6.  
M453,"we would have had to do, when I’m desperate I use like chrashplan to back up my computer and sense drop box is actually on my computer it does get backed up that way.  "
M454,"But yeah, it’s still not as convenient. And then just knowing whether or not somebody edited something or how they edited it.  "
M455,"the only time I just google drive is when we have a lot of data to share. Normally we'll set up a ftp if we are transferring large amounts of data, and in some instances that is not possible.  "
M456,Some people just don’t have the capability to setting up an ftp site.  
M457,"They don’t have and IT person around to set it up for them or they don’t know how, or whatever else, they don’t know how to get into an ftp site you know. Situations like that.  "
M458,"00:48:00 do you ever share data via email -Sarah00:48:06 yeah, all the time -P6.  "
M459,we don’t necessarily want everyone to have access to all the data that goes into one of your drop box folders. So I would say basically if you want to share small amounts of data that can be sent via email.  
M460,just word and end note for references. Some of my friends use papers for references that can be an issue.  
M461,"oh yeah, yeah. Normally for introducing citations into a manuscript we use end note or papers and theirs another one that’s open source the people use. That complicates things a little bit. "
M462,"because if I start a manuscript using end note and I give it somebody and they want to add citations,  they can't unless I share with them my endnote library and they have end note installed on their computer.  "
M463,The same problem if somebody starts a manuscript and they use papers to introduce citations and I don’t have their papers library of course.  
M464,usually we make one person in charge of citations and so I will go through and say insert so and so citation throughout the paper.  
M465,"track changes yeah. I would say the biggest problem in writing manuscripts now days is they are not being a widely, used open source, high quality citation software.  "
M466,endnote Every time they come out with a new version it has new problems and you have to learn how to get around the problems.  
M467,endnote And it’s just a little bit clunky the way the software works it’s a little bit clunky. There is a little bit of a learning curve to it.  
M468,theirs just other weird issues for example my computer I have to send it in because the screen has an issue and so I basically clone my computer onto this one.  
M469,"But for some completely unknown reason you can’t do that with end note and so if you try to open a manuscript with end note citations in it now, with the site while you write feature activated it then it causes word to freeze up and error out with some message that doesn’t make sense.  "
M470,had to do a lot of google search. It’s a really common problem and people did a variety of things. Those people were uninstalling endnote and then reinstalling it. 
M471,". But it turns out you can just turn off the site while you write feature. and then a huge problem with end note, is, so the site while you write feature is fine and good, but if you delete a reference let’s say, there are like a thousand of steps involved in removing that information that you don't really see it, it goes away. "
M472,"But word keeps track of all those steps. So if you go to undo something it’s impossible. So if you just deleted a citation and then your like oh wait, that thing I did two steps ago I want to undo, it’s pretty much impossible. "
M473,"yeah, even though you only did one click to delete something, it’s actually a thousand things that went on in the background.  "
M474,"For me it’s easiest to have somebody to write a draft, sort of a rough draft. And then I edit it, and then if maybe there is another key person involved then that person might edit it. But usually we go through that process multiple times. "
M475,"if there is a third person, that person at least in every instance I can think of, that person is usually sort of a, that person isn't going to see it as much.  "
M476,It is going to the two people usually going back and forth and back and forth and then it goes out to that third person. And then it might go out to multiple other people in the group before it actually gets submitted.  
M477,yeah so we do track changes and that’s sort of the rule of thumb I would say.  
M478,When you are editing a manuscript between different people you use track changes so that person can see what changes you made.  
M479,"Unfortunately, you know if you were to look at this last paper, you know we keep track of which draft we are on. And I think by the time this paper was accepted and all the revisions we made, we were on like draft 52 or something.  "
M480,". And so there is a lot of going back and forth. And eventually there is way too much red, green, and blue from all the track changes and you just, somebody will accept all the changes and you sort of start fresh again back and forth and back and forth. "
M481,"I mean there is always the challenge of you know, people just having the tendency to word things differently or explain things a little bit differently and maybe somebody doesn’t like the way you explain something or you don’t like the way they explain something.  "
M482,"You just kind of accept that it’s not going to be the way you want it done, but it’s not wrong necessarily.  "
M483,"it’s between the two people that are really involved then it is mostly drop box and between that third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, twelfth person involved it’s usually email.  "
M484,"you don’t really want multiple people accessing, so this comes back to sort of the drop box issue, where you don’t necessarily want multiple people to go and access your manuscript and make changes to it.  "
M485,then having to keep track of who needs to see it and who’s turn it is to see it and all of that stuff and the problem of multiple people trying to open it at the same time and edit it.  
M486,"drop box that I did not bring up before, it does happen often enough that occasionally it is an issue where two of us will try to open up the same document to make changes to it.  "
M487,. it is not a big deal because then you save it as a new version but then taking changes out of what that other person made and combining it with the changes you made can be a challenge.  
M488,"Like okay I’m going to make some changes to the manuscript today. After five or tomorrow you can take a look at it, and then the next day I will take a look at it.  "
M489,"if you can somehow just move that sort of idea to not only online but using online software, so like only word and its getting stored in a cloud somewhere and we are all sort of accessing it from the same point, and having sort of more interactive type of system where you know I could be sharing , two of us, two authors on a paper could be looking at it at the same time and just sort of skyping back and forth or some other version of chatting back and forth while we are both making edits.  "
M490,"people might also use the google word, whatever that it, i dont even know, or pages, or whatever else.  "
M491,. it might not have the same exact font or their might some weird little formatting things and it starts introducing problems. so if people are trying to makes edits in one word processing software and you are making yours in a different word proccessing software. 
M492,"Especially if you are talking about citations, so like end note is built into word and stuff. I don’t know if you can incorporate it into pages or google docs or whatever else.  "
M493,"Until there is some software out there the makes it completely seamless to move between word and that other software. And for example when you submit a manuscript you know, there is a couple of different file types they will accept.  "
M494,I’m not the primary researcher. I work in collaboration with the mds that have the patients and they give me the DNA and sequence the DNA and analyses the DNA and tell them the answer  Ok so um in um general on average how many people are on a given project that you’re working on.  
M495,A good question. Anywhere from 2 or 3 up to a dozen. It really varies. 
M496,Ok so I have an md who have great ideas and are awesome at getting money but they don't have the background or the statistical background to build the experiment design nor then pipit.  
M497,alright so I have myself and 7 analysts I work with. Obviously I can't do the work of 100 pis per year.  
M498,Um well the more people you have the more opinions you collect and just the bigger discussions and the less productive they become.  
M499,Everybody has an opinion and every body’s right no body is wrong no one will concede and the bigger the project the worse that gets actually.  
M500,4 to 6 people because each one will have their own jobs to do. So the work gets divide out amongst more people while not getting people who aren't doing much.  
M501,So you can have one person in charge and a lot of people under them then order is maintained but when you have a lot of equals it becomes very unwieldy very fast.  
M502,Get a bunch of mds into he room they all very large egos and very large opinions and it just gets. It gets unwieldly very fast.  
M503,That project in total is probably a couple dozen people and in total. Most of which I’ve never met.  
M504,"Generally larger projects are more well-funded, people because it takes more money to have more people.  "
M505,And so it’s less of an issue of penny pinching it’s just get it done I don't care how.  
M506,It becomes more as the budgets get constrained there are more discussions of what to do and what not to do and why versus just do it.  
M507,an assistant professor comes in with a startup package and has a quarter million dollars so I have a quarter million dollars to get my next grant is essentially what that’s for.  
M508,Um and so it very and in the first it’s a free for all. A quarter million dollar is tons. that gets eaten up pretty quick and then they get penny pinching and get really tight and we'll not do proper controls because they cost too much money and the experimental design flaws simply because we have to conserve funds. 
M509,Of the 100 pis per year most are on my institution simply because that’s where the institution money is. On this institution all on I work with 1 2 3 4 5 at least a half dozen people every year.  
M510,And the informatiticians were either ineffective or left or are currently deluged with others so it’s a supply and demand issue.  
M511,Well yeah it’s just a matter of getting everybody together. It’s more of the herding cats.  
M512,There’s a graduate student with committee or even on skype or just getting 5 minutes together. The more people you have the worse it gets that’s why you only have four or 5 committee members.  
M513,Yes well yes and no um with the advent of skype it’s trivial to get together when 5 minutes are possible.  
M514,Distance becomes less of an issue because we skype with people from Italy. so it’s just a matter of ending time face to face meetings are easier local.  
M515,I have some huge meetings that are done every week and I have some small meetings that are done every week. And I have the opposite. Big meetings never meet. In my mind it doesn't seem correlated
M516,"To be honest I don't see, there’s not particular benefit to them being remote. There’s not necessarily a detriment either. I think it’s more beneficial for them to be closer because of ease but I think it can function easily other direction. "
M517,Locally it’s probably a bit easier. You already have t time issue. Adding a space issue is just an additional I think I pleasantly avoid that. 
M518,I can tack my computer and go to Zimbabwe.  
M519,Actually I’ve worked in Mexico City. Just as easily as I’ve worked here.  
M520,I going to be extreme and say 100 % simply because collaborative science ok so it use to be that a pi would come out with n idea construct the design get it fund get it ankylosed and write the paper.  
M521,The reviewers will read the grant and go you’re an md you can’t do this and it’s gone. They reject it. Collaborativeness actually equates to success now and so almost everyone has multiple disciplines coming together yep. 
M522,That’s the benefit of my job is I don't necessarily understand what. The next person who sits in front of my desk I don't know what the7y have done and what they know. That’s the benefit. I get to play in their sandbox and learn from them
M523,The less they know about any of it. So if you have a bigger the pie the smaller the wedge right? Ask one person knows any of the rest of it.  
M524,Um I’ve had pis who were exceedingly demanding and didn’t understand that people like myself didn’t work for them.  
M525,When you don't get that distinction things go bad fast because there are demands put on you as if you are an employee of that person and then those expectations aren't met.  
M526,Essentially there are people who you can work with and people who you can't work with. I haven't found all that many.  
M527,"Single word respect. So if it’s all of this is collaborative, all of this takes people of different skill sets. It’s about the co respect. "
M528,. It’s how respectful all are to each other and the greater group. If you have a thousand people and they all respect the view of the other it will go smoothly. 
M529,If you have two people who can’t agree it’s going to be a fight the whole way. So it’s about mutual respect. No necessarily the size. 
M530,"Generally this is a one on one face to face thing, because it’s difficult so what I do didn't exist 5 years ago.  "
M531,. So there’s an aspect of even what’s a server? What’s a head node what’s parallel distributed computing. So for them to understand what I do for them that I you have to sit down and I need to see their blank face. 
M532,So quiz them and figure out from their blank face where I need to start. And then generally it’s just treat me like an idea and start from the beginning and it can take hours.  
M533,. I do this in to 2 hour sessions until I see their brains starting to hurt and then I go ok there you go. And so it’s yeah. I find it’s much easier face to face
M534,They know a lot about what they are doing but have no idea what I do and what I can do for them and it’s easier for me to come to them.  
M535,"find it easier to go to them generally, especially if it’s remote and if it’s locally remote I will just drive the hour to come here simply because it’s that much more productive.  "
M536,"Trying to explain mapping algorithms on the phone aunt going to happen, not from 0.  "
M537,"It’s just too complex. Most of the time I need a white board. That’s actually the greater thing, people are visual and if I say I need to take reads and map it to the genome that’s a lot more abstract then me drawing a chromosome and saying it goes right here. "
M538,"ok so we have weekly meetings actually my office is open for them if they have a particular issue, or we have grand discussions on I have this to do there isn't an algorithm to do it thus we need to make it.  "
M539,So webx skype. Guess it depends on how much the visual image is important.  
M540,So the difference between skype and webx is simply you can share a desk top and so if I need to show that them a complex figure you can do that.  
M541,Most of the time I still want to do it in face to face simply because there are things you’re writing down things as I say things. Same thing you can do that on the phone.  
M542,I find it easier face to face. Maybe I’m old school I don't know. Even so the back and forth I found easier face to face even remotely. 
M543,"Other than you know band width issues, skipping and things like that. That would be about the only thing. When you’re at that point you just have to make it work. "
M544,I guess it depends on the longevity of the question that needs to be asked. Phones are generally quick questions.  
M545,He French and has just its tedious to speak to him on the phone he speaks English well. But he stutters in a French dialect. It’s just painful. 
M546,it’s like I there are people even skype any verbal there are some people who don't do well.  
M547,I would prefer. I one would rather walk 10 minutes and look in their door and ask them the question then take e 30 seconds and call the phone simply because there’s a masking of conceptualization.  
M548,so I can ask them a question and I’m not sure if they are answering the correct question vs if I see them and I see on their face and they aren't answering my question and the answer they are giving me is for a different question.  
M549,You can email them all at once basically it’s a time saving feature. It’s a point to where you can spend 30 minutes writing an eloquent argument that you may not be able to derive that same argument on the fly while 6 people are yelling at you.  
M550,. Sometimes written words are necessary just simply to slow time down.  
M551,Yes all the time 100%. Since I work with so many that becomes a huge burden my phone is sitting here vibrating.  
M552,. Quick question but it may take 3 days to answered that email and I’m stuck so it is an issue because of a time lack I guess.  
M553,Ftp Sep I crunch that. Those data file are far far bigger than normal academics are used to dealing with.  
M554,These don't go over email these can barely be drop boxed. Generally for bigger files we'll use something like drop box or I simply make them bring me a 3 terabyte sub drive and I download it for them.  
M555,There are concepts that are completely foreign and it would take me a lot longer to teach them how to go access the sever than for me Tod download to a 3 terabyte drive.  
M556,And so its they can barely deal with the drive. So it’s a matter of educational abilities and time sinks on each side. Sometimes it’s just easier to hand them a disk and make them go away. 
M557,Again it’s a compendency issue. A lot of people can't even use drop box.  
M558,"If it’s, we still have a huge deficit to submit file over the wire. We really don't its self-imposed by infrastructure choses.  "
M559,There are infrastructure problems that necessitate other means just to get it done. You have email drop box serve depending on he size.  
M560,Teleporter. That’s the one thing. I mean technology is matching our need for the most part. 
M561,"Transferring a 100 gig file, that’s tedious. It’s no different to me than a 3 Meg file. It’s the same action it’s just the time that it takes. "
M562,So what is the goal of your research? -SarahTo publish lots of papers so nobody fires me.  
M563,"was like 15 people or so involved in that. Most of them were very peripheral, just helping with basic lab work.  "
M564,Because you get involved across campus in these remotes to microbiology undergrad students who want to get experience.  
M565,"So I mean, if the question is how many people on this campus its only a couple but if its across the states, then its a potential for a solid 10 people in multiple areas of the states.  "
M566,"Totally depends on the project, right. so the E. coli on with all the lab work and all the bits and pieces, you are going to be looking at a minimum of sort of 10 because their are going to be people that are grad students helping out in the lab, so the minimum is 10. "
M567,"the with the dairy dally one you know a lot of it can be done with two people plus committee members, so you are looking at a total of 5. But those peripheral groups that are going to be putting into it, expand that out to 10 plus.  "
M568,"I would say an easy 101 for any given project. They play some substantial role, I guess.  "
M569,largest was the o157 work in Australia they included two institutions and multiple grad students. Looking at sort of 25 people.  
M570,And the smallest group would be 5 or less.  
M571,the main problem is honestly funding because the world has changed as we know it and funding bodies look for people who have multiple collaborations and multiple disciplines.  
M572,so when you try to pull together something small the biggest issue you run into is people not believing you can get enough done with out those multiple collaborators.  
M573,.  
M574,"I’m trying to get the pilot work done or just trying to get some back round noise done, then to be honest to or three people is easier because you can just go get the job done.  "
M575,"you are defiantly limited in terms for outside influence and outside sort of I guess outside collaboration, beyond the people you work with because you don’t have those context and certainly limited by the fact that you don’t necessarily have multiple discipline representing you.  "
M576,"So if you want a project that has a social science bent to it then you better get some social science into and if you want an epidemiologist, you better get an epidemiologist and statisticians, and yada da yada.  "
M577,So I guess that would be the main limitation. If you are only going into it with two or three people you are pretty much limited to what you know.  
M578,I guess I would tend to say that the smaller projects with few numbers of people are certainly less complex.  
M579,"So it’s not just the fact that you can go get the project done, but it usually indicates that the project itself is fairly singular oriented and has linear sort of aspect to it.  "
M580,Yeah I mean the main challenge is the large group honestly. It’s just keeping control of the project right?.  
M581,If you put it in a nutshell the benefit of the large group is that you can have your very discrete roll.  
M582,as a group you have this power of intellect and power and experience and opportunities that you simply can’t pull together in a small group.  
M583,Hands down the benefit is that you don’t have to try to cover all the bases and that’s huge.  
M584,"you’re almost missing the boat if you’re not think about where’s my statistician, epidemiologist, my microbiologist, my population health specialist, my whatever within a project. Everybody kind of focuses on their area to pull the information together.  "
M585,"00:13:24 so slightly different track, about what percentage of your project have involved at least one collaborator at another institution? -Sarah 00:13:34 let me think. At least 50 %.  "
M586,one you can work with collaborators that have more experience and therefor more clout and that’s big.  
M587,"So that's one and the second reason is the same that we were just talking about for the larger projects, at the end of the day you can get people with different skill sets to bring into your project that you might not find in the realm, your own institution.  "
M588,"they kind of choose me because you present somewhere and your chatting about something with someone and the conversation leads into hey we got to work together, its almost not a choice as much as it is just sort of a natural flow.  "
M589,almost an anticipation of where the hang ups will be if you know somebody too much.  
M590,"the most fluid one right now is with someone I have never worked with before, because you are sort of feeling each other out and you know the world is sort of an endless opportunity.  "
M591,Within that same project working with someone who you know fairly well theirs already sort of some barriers if you are not careful because you know what the expectations are for what they are going to do.  
M592,"Bottom line is that having personal contact, being able to have a morning meeting can be extremely helpful.  "
M593,If you can't just drop by somebody’s office and have a quick chat or bump into somebody at another meeting.  
M594,Whereas colocation allows you to say hey lets three of us get together instead of lets pull three phone calls together.  
M595,"That would be so beneficial, phones just don’t cut it. Well skype allows that to some extent, but we don’t tend to do it.  "
M596,"Normally I would email just deal with it that way, not worry about it. But if there’s a deadline in place then the phone call has to come in.  "
M597,I would rather just drop by their office.  
M598,"The only people I skype in general are Australian because phone calls are a nightmare, phone calls are a lot easier.  "
M599,"no, I have not ever tried to do multiple people in a skype.  "
M600,"As much as I can’t stand email, because it puts elements on the receiver as oppose to the person who is sending the email. The reality is, that’s the world we live in.  "
M601,"the truth is it saves a lot of time then running over and just chatting with someone, because as you know when you sit down and chat with somebody you go through all the personal contact stuff as well, and you know you don't just get to the heart of it.  "
M602,With email you can just get to the heart of the question.  
M603,"I mean disadvantages are where you miss a lot of the nuances, right? email.  "
M604,"The advantages are hands down, you can get questions answered quickly as opposed to going through the process of working around the issue as a whole email.  "
M605,"If you make a phone call, you drop by someone’s off, or do a skype the question is answered. And that gets back to the whole deadline issue, so certainly their can be issues with turn around time.  "
M606,00:24:43 so what percentage of your projects involves collaborators who are in different fields than yours -Sarah00:24:55 you’re asking as a percentage? 25% -P9.  
M607,"yes, the major disadvantage is that their can be quite some time needed to be put into some sort of up front explanation from everybody's perspective of why things are going to get done the way they are going to get done.  "
M608,. Instead of just having a mutual understanding of that foundational knowledge of why are we going to do things the way we are going to do things.  
M609,benefits are that you get your eyes open to alternative ways to doing things that you haven’t thought of or alternative issues you might have over looked.  
M610,"its super easy to just get so linearly focused on what you need to get done, you can miss a lot of those peripheral things that can be really influential and usually working with people outside your own discipline will shed light on that.  "
M611,"You will have a lot of people who have a very difficult time seeming outside of their own boundaries. So working within a discipline in my case of vets, it can be very challenging for people to accept somebody else’s view point.  "
M612,"If size in sense, in a way large size in a colocation can almost be more of hindrance than a large size in multiple in situations.  "
M613,Large size in a collocated institution the expectation is that you are going to pull everybody together. And that means getting numerous people on one side at one time and that is the hardest thing to possibly do.  
M614,It is much easier to get multiple people on a phone than it is to get multiple people in a room.  
M615,phone conferences in my experience allow you to get very select things covered whereas meetings in person allow you to get multiple things covered.  
M616,In a phone call it seems like the dominant personalities almost have to lead or silence sets in.  
M617,"If you got good facilitators, a phone conference can still do amazing things, you can get everybody's input.  "
M618,"Even if you are a quite type, the fact that you are sitting across the table from people pretty much necessitates that somebody is going to call you out at some point for input.  "
M619," I think size, in my mind is the most dangerous because by virtue of size, you pretty much in most cases, dictated that you probably will have multiple disciplines and you will probably are going to have multiple locations and therefore you have created a scenario that’s reliant on everybody's piece of the puzzle.  "
M620,"Again smaller group, different disciplines you can probably make sure to work together to get things done.  "
M621,"It is pretty easy for some researchers to drop out of the mix in a large group and that can ultimately be, you know, a herald of death for the whole thing, right?.  "
M622,Technology is 100% behind the ultimate data.  
M623,"34 we do things like drop box for the, you know files that are being sent from one dairy to the next.  "
M624,"So that’s the main thing. I mean their are other routes you can just grab a USB off the farm, etcetera. But drop box is kind of becoming the way for most of the file sharing for the big data sets that we use for the dairies. "
M625,That’s just what the farmers are comfortable with so that’s what they use dropbox.  
M626,"no the only issue I have is if you want, say I wanted a question about a cow today, the files may not be there today. So then you got to go through the ringer role to contact somebody to put that up.  "
M627,"well you've got a singular point in time whereas with drop box if you establish that contact, then you can get the records today but then if I have a question next week I can get them to do that as well.  "
M628,"00:37:14 you also mentioned quite a bit about writing papers, what do you use to write your papers? What editor? -Sarah00:37:24 just Microsoft word.  "
M629,"You may be the lead on it, but I don’t know that I will ever write a paper again honestly that doesn’t have some level of collaboration because that's not the nature of the game anymore.  "
M630,"But the primary ways is just a simple word document track changes, realistically.  "
M631,"typically I am only working with maximum of 3 to 4 people who have to play a role in it, just emailing. There have been recently, a couple of different grants that I have worked on with other people with file sharing via, a drop box or something.  "
M632,"with an email the process is pretty easy to have your version, send it out maybe to the group and say hey so and so you are next in line for this.  "
M633,So I do love this system that I can’t think of on the top of my head that we used most recently where is aloud multiple where everyone could be editing at once.  
M634,"yeah sure, a hard copy. That still does happen, there are certainly people that we work with that are more comfortable with a red pen and a hard copy.  "
M635,You can’t just sort of infuse what they have put down with having to go back through the whole process. Efficiency is missing.  
M636,"I mean I will have single file that is on a hard drive somewhere. That people can edit as needed, but yeah it’s a single spot.  "
M637,That’s a good question because I don't know if you have been following what has happened with science and the whole issue with data management from the guy who did the survey.  
M638,And I suspect that I won’t probably work with people that I would have trust issues with.  
M639,"honestly the main one would be what I was talking about earlier that I, for the life of me can’t think of the term, holograms.  "
M640,There is supposed to be work out there that has actually done this where you can have hologram meetings. That would be huge for me.  
M641,"If we could ever get to the point where we could all virtually all be around a table, so we could all be in our own room, I don't care where we are. But we are virtually all around a table and it feels like we are all virtually around a table. Honestly I think that would be huge. "
M642,And the other thing from a technological stand point that I think about is actually scaling back technology a little bit with emails and I don’t have an answer for this but I would love there to be rapid communication that still puts the elements of the outcome on the person generating the communication.  
M643,"Because in an email, it’s off my plate, it is now in your plate. So I don’t know how to describe what I was suggesting but I would love it if somehow there is still ownership similar to face to face, similar to a phone call.  "
M644,"so that anytime I am asking for a favor it doesn’t just get done totally point blank away from me once I hit the send bottom, Do that make sense.  "
M645,Because truthfully emails have gotten to the point where accountability is just shot.  
M646,You can just send out a drove of email to ever the hell you want to and walk way and go for a bike ride and disappear and not I just put it on 20 other people to do my job for me. I don't like that. I hate that actually. 
M647,"Most of it is associated with improving public safety associated with consumption of meat and food products, or their demand in satisfaction with those products.  "
M648,"Just in actual scientists, probably.  I don't have the full count, but what I'm gonna say, at least 20"
M649," Oh, it ranges anywhere from two to, this might be the biggest that I've, the biggest number of collaborators that I've worked with.  "
M650,"There's actually more people than what I've listed, so I'm talking here about just the people that are intimately contributing to the project. There's a whole lot of peripheral people that are involved also that, they may not be directly helping to conduct the study, but they're involved in one form of fashion or another.  "
M651,"So anywhere from two to twenty-five or thirty. It varies. And, you know, a lot of the projects I do, I mean, I do projects anywhere from eight thousand dollars to two and a half million dollars, so there's a lot of variation in the scope and size of some of the projects we work on. "
M652,"Some of them were, are, are completed for the industries, I mean, specific companies.  "
M653,"Fair enough. So, I don't know if this is specifically answering your question, but as scientists become older, and become more senior in terms of what they do, their responsibilities sort of change.  "
M654,"So, disadvantages when you have small numbers of collaborators.  you can't answer questions, you can't address hypothesis that are as wide in scope"
M655,the advantage to having a big team like we have in our USDA studies is that everybody in that team is contributing a very different piece of expertise.  
M656,"so, Christina Boucher is a analytical whiz, bioinformatics, you know, big data vs.  I don't know the first thing about that, you know"
M657,"when you take people with those differing levels of expertise and you put them together, then the scope and the magnitude of the question that you can answer becomes much greater.  "
M658,"So, but you can't, the big drawback is you can't answer questions of magnitude that require differing areas of expertise.  "
M659,"Everybody in our, on our team, and this is true really for most of the teams I've worked on, everybody on our team is a truly important component of the team.  "
M660,"we were working with some scientists that worked for the government, the federal government, and they were self-interested, and as a consequence they feared we were evaluating collectively several technologies that were in the process of development for commercialization and use widespread, worldwide, in the industry.  "
M661,"And they essentially threw us under the bus, because they were out for themselves.  "
M662,Negative peer-reviewed scientific publication that we didn't even have the opportunity to have it snapping sound.  
M663,"So, if it's self-serving, if collaborators are self-serving, collaborations in my historical experience don't, they don't last, they fail.  "
M664,"what you'll find in science is that, time goes on, is, you know, in the days of Louis Pasteur, one scientist can answer big questions.  "
M665,"Today, questions are so complex, that that can't happen. There's no one scientist that can answer most of the questions that are big problems facing society.  "
M666,"We work, course, we're more selective now in collaborators we choose to work with.  "
M667,"If I were to pick one thing that we have experience, perhaps in other studies, it's lack of some of our partner institutions doing things on time.  "
M668,"So one of the things, one of the reasons we're successful in obtaining a research fund is, we get things done on time.  "
M669,"If a company comes to us and they need an answer next week, we get it done next week. We don't take on the project and then say, sorry, we can't get it done for next month.  "
M670,"so we need to partner with them, just to have access to the technology.  "
M671,"We work with another scientist there that's a bioinformatics collaborator, and he brings something to the table in our group that we don't have on campus anywhere, at least, currently.  "
M672,"And sometimes the need is equipment or expertise in methodologies, or something like that. And, so, we frequently go to other institutions for things like that.  "
M673,It's nice when everybody can get together for a quick impromptu meeting if you need to.  
M674,"So, that's a nice convenience of it, but, with technology nowadays, you're pretty much in constant communication with your collaborators, so it's not that big of a deal I don't know if there are challenges; there's, if you select the right collaborators, then there's never a challenge as there is, but there is sometimes differences in vernacular and language and, technical language that's used to discuss things.  "
M675,"I've been trained by a certain culture, by a certain group of people that have certain backgrounds, and it's fun to work with others who have different backgrounds, different training, different skills, that think about things differently. So, it's fun.  "
M676,"Yes, it does. I mean, if you have, if you don't have such a huge group, and they're all speaking the same language, then maybe you don't meet so frequently.  "
M677,". But on big projects, like this USDA project that we're working on, you have to meet very frequent.  "
M678,"And, you know, we don't take, we take holiday weeks off and things like that, but generally speaking, we meet every week.  "
M679,"Cause people can take raw data and they can make them say a lot of different things than what they were designed to answer questions about, and that is always a concern, because there's a lot people that are pseudo-scientists out there.  "
M680,"I mean, the scientific method means you ask a question, you design study to answer that question, you do the study, you analyze the results, and then you objectively answer the question.  "
M681,"If you're a scientist, I mean, by de facto, you must also tell the truth, right.  "
M682,"There's a lot about the handling of big data that I'm probably not the one to ask about it, I mean, we have other experts in the area, like Christina.  "
M683,"If it's not a sensitive file, you know, we'll just email it to somebody.  "
M684,"Sometimes if it's more sensitive, again, thumb drives or hard disks.  "
M685,"So, it just depends on the degree of security that's required to protect either the identity of, of companies or people that contributed to the data, or.  I mean, if there's some reason it needs to be secure, more secure, then we handle it appropriately"
M686,big data stuff is difficult.  
M687,"But, you know, they're files that you can transmit with the 10 MB or 15 or 20 MB capabilities of an email system.  "
M688,"Well, I think the federal government has learned that you have to protect your, your storage systems, right?.  "
M689,"I don't know, again, we would not do that if it were sensitive data, but, so I'm not worried about somebody hacking it and obtaining it and misusing it, because, you know, it's not sensitive, so.  "
M690,"Well, the Canadian government's a little picky about who they allow to have access to their information.  "
M691,"It's federal Canadian policy that they're not going to give us access to their servers, and so we have to figure out other mechanisms for transferring them.  "
M692,"Face-to-face, we email a lot, we've used Skype and other electronic meeting platforms. We travel, a lot, which would, I guess, go into face-to-face category. Telephones, of course. Texting"
M693,"will say this about texting, like if you, if you're communicating with people that are in other countries, it's much cheaper, because if you don't have internet access, it's expensive in another country, and texting you can usually do inexpensively.  "
M694,"34 Face-to-face meetings, I'd like to minimize, cause I have too many of them.  "
M695,"it's much more difficult to fully understand with the jargon, and the technical jargon, and, you know, the different things that differing expertises bring to the party.  "
M696,"You've gotta be able to ask questions and have a dialog about that, and that's difficult to do with electronic communication. You can do it with, like, Skype, or something like that, but, even then, it's difficult.  "
S666,"The goal of my research really is to, to establish evidence upon which we can base sort of those preventative strategies in a veterinary hospital. So that would include being able to impact health care associative infections in animals as well as zoonotic infections in people. And so, that sort of yeah, shows the bulk of it. "
S667,"How many collaborators?I've got one that's on crypto and let me see.  I think there are five, let me look at it. Collaborators"
S668,"Okay, so what is your role on this project? 00:03:20 I am the PI on this project.  "
S669,So this project is working towards characterization of the prevention practices and occupational exposure verse veterinary personnel (unaudible).  
S670,What is the average number of researchers on the projects?I'm probably averaging six right now. PID:  P14.  
S671,What is your role in these research projects?I am the PI on about four projects right now. And then I am a co-investigator on about five other ones.  
S672,Uh.  Number of researchers. 00:05:03(For largest project)P14: Number of researchers
S673,"Okay, and then the smallest? 00:05:08(smallest number of people on project)P14: Smallest would be two.  "
S674,"So the disadvantages are that basically it's just the two of you that are responsible for getting everything done, so you have to try to bring in, potentially have to try and bring in other people to help, and they may not be listed as a PI or a co-investigator on the project. And so then you are left with sort of trying to get them to help you. Some will do it just because they're collaborators of yours and they'll help out no matter what and others want something in return right? They'll want to be on the paper or get some recognition of some kind and so that, that can be a bit awkward. "
S675,"For larger projects it's hard cause you can draw on a lot of different expertise. So it's nice because none of us are an expert at everything and so that, I find hugely beneficialPID:P14.  "
S676,"I think it's a bit more difficult to manage a larger group, harder to find meeting times, sometimes harder to come to a consensus on how you should do things, but I think with a larger group, you end up needing to make sure that you've got particular people assigned to particular tasks. And not let it get to crowded, otherwise you'll never come to a consensus and people will get hurt feelings and all of that. And the other challenge of course is figuring out who goes on which manuscript and in what order. "
S677,What percent of your projects have involved at least one collaborator at another institution?  00:08:19Probably let's see.  90% of them at this point. Most of them involve a collaborator at CSU
S678,"who goes on which manuscriptwhoever is the PI on there, I think probably has the final say on what happens, but I think you need to hold on to the idea that people need to be you know, major contributor whether that's with the design of the study, with analyzing the data, with interpreting the data, they need to be major contributors to make it on that list, and then I think it's not a bad practice to decide order of authors based on number one you know.  "
S679,what percentage have involved collaborators at different institutes?P14: What percentage.  ? Probably only 20%. 
S680,"Why did you choose to work with them?You’ve got some avenue in or you've been introduced as an expert in the area that they need some help. So a lot of times it will be that, especially when you are new faculty, you sort of tumble into these things and then as you get going you start to developing those yourself. So it's really me going and looking or them going and looking for somebody that could be of benefit and somebody directs them sort of your way. "
S681,"What roles are your collaborators at other institutions playing?Some of them are providing oversight so some of the grants that I'm on are for new faculty and so that they have a training component with them and so they'll be sort of oversight. Sometimes there will be (unaudible) that have expertise on the data analysis side or particular detection methods that you wanna use, and so you bring them in to help with that.  "
S682,"Have you ever worked with a collaborator you were unfamiliar withWhen you go to an institution that like, welcome to my world at Virginia Tech or it's like I'm introducing these people.  I don't know them at all, but I'm expected to develop projects with them and so, that happens just because of the nature of the beast. "
S683,"Have you ever worked with a collaborator you were unfamiliar withThere have been other times where I haven't necessarily, well yeah, I did reach out, I submitted a grant to look at the veterinary microbe that are (unaudible). Then I reached out to an expert here on that Virginia Tech campus that I don't know that worked with the Virginia bioinformatics institute for guidance on (unaudible) and that kind of thing.  "
S684,"disadvantages or challenges working with collaborators I think the negatives are that you're all at different institutions, it's a lot harder to meet face-to-face, you're doing a lot of Skype meetings and that kind of thing, and those, and those can be a challenges.  "
S685,"advantages working with collaboratorsAdvantages.  I think it's always good to bring people in from all over because they all have different experiences and bring something different to the table. And I think that different universities sometimes have different equipment available and different skill sets available, so I think that can be important"
S686,"disadvantages or challenges working with collaboratorsthere's a lot of communication that happens when you're talking face-to-face, but you don't necessarily get when you're like on a conference call, and you'll get some of that on Skype cause sometimes you can see people.  "
S687,"do challenges or benefit change at different institutionsit can be really difficult to get everybody at the same time to talk about a project. So I think the more institutions you have right, the bigger that sort of network gets for one project, the more difficulties you can have on making sure that everybody is on the same page.  "
S688,"do challenges or benefit change at different institutionsif I have multiple collaborators (unaudible) at csu, which really is a little bit easier for them to show up in one room and then you just have that one you know interface that you have to create so you can talk to people.  "
S689,disadvantages or challenges associated with colocationI think the advantages is that they're all here and it's a little bit easier to go talk one on one and to make sure that you all are working together.  
S690,"advantages associated with colocationThe negative is I think sometimes if you don't get outside of the institution, you don't ever get sort of new information and new ideas. And so I think, I think that's pretty valuable to have. And so I think that can be a negative for just sticking with folks at your institution. "
S691,what percentage of your projects have involved collaborators that are in different research fields?they bring something different to the table for me and so yeah I think the majority of them probably 60%.  
S692,"Disadvantages or challenges with working with people in different fieldsThe disadvantages you're typically speaking a different language so that can be a challenge where it's like you're all trying to you know common goal that you're you you can't you you don't connect and so I think when you're doing that, you have to really take some time to establish sort of what you know provide some definitions right?.  "
S693,"advantages with working with people in different fieldsthey bring a different point of view, they're bringing their own set of expertise to the table and so that, that's definitely an advantage.  "
S694,Disadvantages with working with people in the same fieldThe negative is sometimes they're very opinionated and if they're a strong personality that can be a challenge to manage. I think also it can be tough sometimes because you get done with your graduate work and then you go into that field and I think sometimes until you sort of establish yourself people might still consider you a graduate student in that field.  
S695,advantages with working with people in the same fieldyou've got people who understand what you're trying to do. They understand the language.  
S696,How frequently do you meet with collaboratorsIt depends on the project. Obviously.  I typically try to reach out monthly if I haven't heard from them
S697,"Does the frequency of meetings change with location?I think I'm much more proactive on setting you know on setting up meetings, and keeping in touch and making sure you know what's going on because they're offsite. I also think that if they're new at doing this or you're concerned about you know conflict protocols, and that would also be another reason I would tend to meet with them more other than less.  "
S698,"Have you ever had a project fail because of collaborationI've never had a project not finish because of collaborators. I had, I've had a project you know fall apart quite a bit and one that you know we had to put back together and finish without that person. it was a person that was just not agreeable to work. "
S699,which do you think has the biggest impact on the outcome of a projectBackground of the people you are working with. I think that it's definitely critical that the background of the person that's leading the charge needs to maybe be somebody that has been successful in the past and has some skills when it comes to dealing with large groups.  
S700,"Skills to be successful in a large groupBeing able to provide leadership, being able to identify potential issues between collaborators, and knowing how to manage that. I think having somebody that's a good mentor at the top. Being able to work alongside colleagues that are their equals as well as fostering that learning and growing of you know colleagues that are new colleagues right, that are younger and coming up through the ranks. "
C1,Are there any other tasks you do that when you're doing your research involve working with another personCertainly when you write the grant that typically involves other people for me whether it's bouncing the idea off them or having them as a collaborator and having them working on the grant or having that person that maybe isn't on the grant but is going to read your work for you to give you some feedback.  
C2,"Are there any other tasks you do when you work with another personI think when you develop the study design it gets critical that you have other people involved in that right? And it will be people with your same you know, that are epidemiologists for me (unaudible) in the same field that you all sort of depending on what you're doing.  "
C3,"what about bench work or data analysis with other peopleI think data analysis can be sort of collaborative, although I tend to do my own. But I will reach out to people when I need help with stuff, so that's you know collaboration. Benchwork I've I've typically have done my own, but now course I have students and so there's sort of it's not as much as a collaboration as it is a mentorship. It depends on who's got the expertise that you need"
C4,"What about sharing your dataThe current data that I'm generating, that's something I'll have to decide, how available that data will be for other people to use. There's pluses and minuses to that right? You want people to have access to your data and to use it and benefit from that, but the flip side to that is that you want to be able to use that data for further research.  "
C5,"sharing data with your collaborators 00:26:31 definitely share with my collaborators, yep.  "
C6,"What tools or methods do you use to shareI typically use dropbox to share stuff. That's the only one I can figure out how to use. I'm trying to use google docs, but it's not totally intuitive to me, so that doesn't work. And then the email right? You'll email stuff to people"
C7,"What about sharing with google docI'm either just handicapped or like I find it so, I like difficult (unaudible) and you'll try to you know have a a inter you know a document that everybody can work on, but then you make comments, and you comments don't show up because I didn't do the right thing. It just is not (unaudible) for me on how to freakin use that program and so it is jus ta nightmare, and so so I, that's why I quit using it.  "
C8,"What tools or methods do you use to shareI tend to just put stuff in dropbox and then I email somebody, okay it's you're turn, go look at this, and make edits, and you've got three days, and then when they're done, it's like okay the next person, this is yours now. We do this a lot when we're developing.  "
C9,drop box versus sending it in an email. If I am looking for very specific feedback on one thing. A lot of times I'll just shoot the document to that person. 
C10,"drop box versus sending it in an email. drop box allows us to have multiple copies. Sometimes resources. So, if if we found a good reference that we want people to read"
C11,"Have you ever had any issues come up when So one issue would be that people don't know how to do it and they'll take the document out of the dropbox and put it on their own computer. So they'll drag it instead of copying it. Another will be if you're dropbox starts filling up, so you share it with somebody and if they start adding stuff to it without sort of thinking about the fact that it's filling up space in the dropboxusing dropbox. "
C12,"Have you ever had any issues come up when people sometimes take stuff off unknowingly right and then people don't think about the fact when they put stuff in there, make sure that it's relevant and it's small enough that it's not going to clog up other peoples dropboxes.  "
C13,"are there any people that you choose not to use dropbox withNot yet. I can see why I might now do dropbox with someone if I think that they don't know how to use it, but in general I feel like most of the people that I work with are, know about dropbox.  "
C14,"have you ever had data that was too large put on dropbox?Yes, yeah and so it will.  Huh?. "
C15,what do you do if dropbox is fulltry to email it to them or cut it into chunks or hopefully meet with them face-to-face and try and get it transferred to their computer thingy that yeah.  
C16,"what editors do you use to write your papers?Oh, yeah Word. (unaudible) talking about, I'm very computery you can tell. I know what I'm doing. Yeah, I use Word, yep"
C17,"Why Word?Cause that's what's on my computer. So, my computer is owned by Virginia Tech and this is what they put on it. I can probably request something else, it's what I'm used to, so that's what's on there. "
C18,"are you emailing the document back and forth or commenting.  ? yeah sometimes if I just be that I'm struggling with this section and I'll cut a section out and paste it in the email, but a lot of times it will be the whole document. I tend, when I, when I write I tend to put notes along the side if there's a big question (unaudible) some of the people so that they can then address that and provide you with the information you need"
C19,"So have you ever had any issues using Microsoft Word with to collaborate on papersNo, not that I know of.  "
C20,"how do you communicate with collaborators I'll use face time on my phone sometimes for face-to-face when we're not face-to-face. Otherwise, sometimes it's text messaging too like (unaudible) stuff in the lab with. If they're having an issue it'll, they'll text message me. "
C21,"How often do you use Skype for meetingsRight now, it's pretty infrequent. Over the last year though, it's probably monthly cause I had four projects running with students on them.  "
C22,"When were you using Skype over a different kind of communication methodsometimes it feels like it's just easier to have the conversation rather than trying to type it. so I think that having that actual conversation and I, I tend not, I don't like to talk on the phone. And so it's sort of nice to be able to see them and have that you know. "
C23,"When were you using Skype over a different kind of communication methodeven though you're so far away to be able to see the person you're talking to, so I tend to do it with things like that where I really want to know what's going on with the project and make sure everything is good. And it tends to be with sort of novices as opposed to more seasoned researchers. And a lot of times that might just be a conference call. "
C24,what is the benefit of doing a conference call over SkypeThe conference call seems like sometimes people are more willing to do that. They can do that anywhere. When you do the Skype you need them to have that defined period of time where they can actually sit in front of their computer right and be able to Skype with you. 
C25,"Have you ever had any issues when using SkypeYeah, I've had some connectivity issues, sometimes the video doesn't work very well. That's pretty much it, otherwise, and it sometimes is hard to find the person you know when you're trying to make that initial contact.  "
C26,"Issues with conference callingThe issue is figuring out how to do it cause every phone system is different so that's a little bit of a nightmare, and you have to jump through all these hoops and figure out how to do it.  "
C27,"issues with facetimein general it works pretty well. And it's funny because I usually do that when it's like this really quick you know, need to chat with you quickly, and you'll face time versus Skype , I tend to that whe n I expect to have a longer conversation for some reason, but I hyave no idea why I do that now that I think about it.  "
C28,"how is face time fasterfacetime is right on my phone right? And so they've got facetime on their phone, which a lot of people do, instead of doing a phone call, you just hit face time, and it connects them and you can talk to them and see a video right? You can see them? And so it's kind of nice.  "
C29,"issues with face timeSometimes with your computer it's hard to sort of show people what you're doing and that's sort of why I like it. It's my mobile device right? And it's easier to use. I have Skype on my phone too, but I don't generally use Skype on my phone. I usually use Skype on my labtop"
C30,"text messaging. texting or does that include email?No, SMS texting, so.  It might be email cause you get it right away, but I"
C31,"Issues with text messages Sometimes the text can be delayed. It gets sort of stuck in cyber space and then eventually it gets to you, so that's sort of a bummer. Cause usually it's something they need to know now, which is sort of why they're doing that. And why they don't call you I don't know"
C32,"what's the benefit of using text messaging over other forms of communication?They want an answer to that doesn't need a whole email. And quite frankly text messaging we're okay using sort of shorter versions of words and it in a really short message, whereas email even when you do it on you're phone, you tend to type things out. And so I think it takes longer. "
C33,when do you do face to face meetings?I do that with people who are physically located in my location right?If I've got projects that need to have group meetings and we'll get together somewhere on campus. I tend to try to do face to face meetings with collaborators when we're at the same conferences. Take advantage of that time. 
C34,when would you choose to do a face to face meeting over you know SkypeWhen they're in the same location I always prefer to do the face to face meetings. The reason I sort of lean to the face times and the Skyping is because I've got a lot of folks that are not physically here.  
C35,hypothetical future technology PART 1It would be that platform that would let you have shared documents that were easilly accessible and that it was very obvious how to use and edit them in real time and have them show up. It would be a big enough platform that it could house you know a reasonable amount of data. It would be something that has you know a video conference sort of capability that could be you know either lab top based or you know an iphone type idea right?. 
C36,"hypothetical future technology PART 2It would have some apps that would support though that kind of interactive collaborative group work, but it would be nice to have that all in one package instead of we're talking about all these different, all these different things that I have to sign in to and log on to to get anything done. So it would be nice to have that one centralized thing that provides all that.  "
C37,"hypothetical future technology PART 3Organized, easier to find, and can be all included in one location. In a secure location. (unaudible) hypothetically is a cloud based right service that everybody can access, so that you can you know invite people too right?. "
C38,"hypothetical future technology PART 4Where they can provide this sort of Google Docs platform, but it's so not user friendly that I I can't use it and then (unaudible) a lot of the people I work with can't use it and so, so yeah having all that in an easy to use platform where it's all included. You sign in and you're there would be great. Especially if they could host that video conference where you basically just sign in and there's something there you can all j8ust talk to each other. "
C39,"when would you use drop box over the serverright now I tend to use it pretty heavily because I don’t have access to a server at isalso find that for some collaborators they aren't familiar with accessing servers, especially from a different location. so their just it’s a lot easier for them to open their email or get online really quick and go to their drop box page so like my post doc advisor for instance.  "
C40,issues with sharing over serverno currently no I think it’s always been ok besides servers just being not accessible or something like that. Usually that gets worked out within a few hours or a couple of days at the least.  
C41,when would you send data on a hard drive over something elseThere’s always a separate hard copy or in the case where everybody or the key people involved didn't have access to a server. Usually everybody has drop box. I could imagine needing to send stuff that is much bigger than my capacity on drop box. A drive might be good
C42,when did you choose to use email instead of drop box or serverif it’s like a quick result or a snap shot of something. Or a quick update. Like a small piece of data that is taken out of context of the project and you just want quick feedback on or if people are working on it. If you are e optimizing something let’s say you might send an email with a couple of quick pictures or files of data
C43,forms of communication I talk on the telephone and on skype. Um if we're going to be at a meeting or a social event. Usually try to get together to talk about things in person. That’s pretty much it
C44,what are the benefits of talking in person?well it’s just always easier to explain things. You can you know sketch on pieces of paper and draw things out. You can read things better. you can have a more focused conversation usually you can see if you know if it’s just you talking to a person rather than maybe other stuff going on in the background and also I mean like there’s really nothing better than one on one communication
C45,disadvantages to talking in personit can be hard to find that face time.  
C46,what do you do when you can't find that face time and you need to talk to somebodyemail and set up a time to skype.  
C47,have you ever had issues using email to communicateyes I can be difficult sometimes because email can come off as being impersonal. It’s hard to dictate tone via email and you know there’s auto corrections are not corrections. Also there’s often times a sense of urgency with email. If people come to expect that you check your email all the time and you respond immediately
C48,advantage of using email over something like skypeI tend to go to email more than skype. I think it’s easier to write my thoughts done and keep it organized. Also usually with email you can keep a train of thought going. So you can see
C49,advantage of using email over something like skypehaving that written history is a great reference point. It’s easy to search. You can find it any time doesn't matter what the other person was doing or where they are. Usually it’s easy to send small attachments
C50,when would you choose to use skype over emailI would prefer to use skype for just weekly checking meetings. I would want to skype with somebody everyday unless it was super necessary. Its seems more complicated to set up you know appointments. But if it’s a group of larger than 3-4 people
C51,do you frequently do phone callsyes.  
C52,have you ever had any issues when using phone calls for communicating with your collaboratorsno I mean sometimes if you've got a group phone call with speaker phone. It can be hard that makes everybody gets heard. It’s the same with talking to your mom on the phone. Sometimes they’re just not listening
C53,benefits to having a phone call over email or skype it’s just easier to hash out ideas and have a quick back and forth. Email you have to write and wait for a response. On a phone conversation things can flow more rapidly and you can get on the same page a lot faster or work through a technical issue a lot easier. There’s less chance of misunderstanding I would say because you can Gaige tone and think things through I would say
C54,have you often had issues with using skypesometimes it’s hard to schedule for somebody who is in a different part of the world. Other than that not really. Usually it works pretty well. 
C55,when you’re preparing for publication. What tools do you use? usually drop box so put figures there put draft manuscripts there. I do all my documents in MS Word. Figures are made in various programs depending on who’s making what figures
C56,can you describe that work flow when working with other people on manuscripts: PART 1so usually I like to think about authorship from eh beginning and detail responsibilities from eh beginning of the project. Obviously that may change over time. I think that’s a good way to set things up. Then everybody knows clearly what they are contributing and what they are responsible for and then usually it’s just you work not eh to-do list
C57,can you describe that work flow when working with other people on manuscripts: PART 2so as people generate data or figures worth of data than that usually gets put onto drop box and whoever the first author is responsible for collating that and writing the manuscript. Usually that gets shared with he other people involved and they can edit portions of it.  
C58,issues using drop box while collaboration on a manuscriptyes there was one manuscript that we were using recently that a couple of the people that were using drop box weren't super familiar with it and they end up taking files on and not putting them up or trying to edit while someone else was trying to edit.  
C59,challenges or benefits when you have collaborators working at multiple institutions?I guess just I mean the benefits are hopefully that you have people who are experts in the field. You know who are bringing something to the table in that respect. And challenges is the more people the harder it is to get people to keep in touch. 
C60,do you feel that having people at multiple institutions has an effect on the outcome of a project: PART 1I mean if it goes well than usually it’s considered to be even more successful because you were able to overcome that challenge of having people in many places and get everything done.  
C61,do you feel that having people at multiple institutions has an effect on the outcome of a project: PART 2sometimes it can put an extra expense not eh project so if you need to ship samples to another university that can get quite expensive or if you need to buy reagents or particular something like that or order it for somebody else to get or your waiting for something else from somebody.  
C62,future technology: PART 1I guess um ideally it would need to be accessible. From like your phone or laptop since that’s. Those are the devices I have with me all the time. Secure when a project is in an early phase
C63,future technology: PART 2 Something that would allow a really interactive I guess to have data storage and visualization and be able to communicate really easily. I can't imagine what it would be besides you know guess right now I’m used to using all these different things to share information. Guess if it was tied to an electronic lab notebook that would be easy to where people had access to it. 
C64,future technology: PART 3you basically just don't want people getting access to your data before it gets published. There have been instances in implant biology genetics and breeding and for some crop species there has been a concern recently about data being stolen. You never know what that leads to but usually people are guarded about sharing their information until it’s been published. 
C65,have you ever had concerns when working with collaborators about sharing your data. no. I usually work with trust worthy people.
